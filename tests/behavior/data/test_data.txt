merry christmas ! !!
merry christmas ! !
people are proud to be saying merry christmas again . i am proud to have led the charge against the assault of our cherished and beautiful phrase . merry christmas ! !! ! !
the tax cut/reform bill , including massive alaska drilling and the repeal of the highly unpopular individual mandate , brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had . don’t let the fake news convince you otherwise . and our insider polls are strong!
the fake news refuses to talk about how big and how strong our base is . they show fake polls just like they report fake news . despite only negative reporting , we are doing well - nobody is going to beat us . make america great again!
@foxnews-fbi’s andrew mccabe , in addition to his wife getting all of this money from m clinton puppet , he was using , allegedly , his fbi official email account to promote her campaign . you obviously cannot do this . these were the people who were investigating hillary clinton.
remember , the republicans are 5-0 in congressional races this year . in senate , i said roy m would lose in alabama and supported big luther strange - and roy lost . virginia candidate was not a trumper , and he lost . good republican candidates will win big!
the stock market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low . so many things accomplished by the trump administration , perhaps more than any other president in first year . sadly , will never be reported correctly by the fake news media!
wow , fbi lawyer james baker reassigned , according to @foxnews.
fbi deputy director andrew mccabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits . 90 days to go ? !!!
how can fbi deputy director andrew mccabe , the man in charge , along with leakin’ james comey , of the phony hillary clinton investigation including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails be given $700,000 for wife’s campaign by clinton puppets during investigation?
remember , the most hated part of obamacare is the individual mandate , which is being terminated under our just signed tax cut bill.
today , it was my great honor to sign the largest tax cuts and reform in the history of our country . full remarks:
the united nations security council just voted 15-0 in favor of additional sanctions on north korea . the world wants peace , not death!
congressman ron desantis is a brilliant young leader , yale and then harvard law , who would make a great governor of florida . he loves our country and is a true fighter!
95% of americans will pay less or , at worst , the same amount of taxes mostly far less . the dems only want to raise your taxes!
will be signing the biggest ever tax cut and reform bill in 30 minutes in oval office . will also be signing a much needed 4 billion dollar missile defense bill.
with all my administration has done on legislative approvals broke harry truman’s record , regulation cutting , judicial appointments , building military , va , tax cuts & reform , record economy/stock market and so much more , i am sure great credit will be given by mainstream news?
the president has accomplished some absolutely historic things during this past year . thank you charlie kirk of turning points usa . sadly , the fake mainstream media will never talk about our accomplishments in their end of year reviews . we are compiling a long & beautiful list.
at some point , and for the good of the country , i predict we will start working with the democrats in a bipartisan fashion . infrastructure would be a perfect place to start . after having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the middle east , it is time to start rebuilding our country!
so true !
our big and very popular tax cut and reform bill has taken on an unexpected new source of love - that is big companies and corporations showering their workers with bonuses . this is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of , and now it is the rage . merry christmas!
thank you to everyone who joined me at the @whitehouse yesterday . together , we are making america great again !
house democrats want a shutdown for the holidays in order to distract from the very popular , just passed , tax cuts . house republicans , don’t let this happen . pass the c . r. today and keep our government open!
home sales hit best numbers in 10 years ! make america great again
was @foxandfriends just named the most influential show in news ? you deserve it - three great people ! the many fake news hate shows should study your formula for success!
the massive tax cuts , which the fake news media is desperate to write badly about so as to please their democrat bosses , will soon be kicking in and will speak for themselves . companies are already making big payments to workers . dems want to raise taxes , hate these big cuts!
we are making america great again !
we are delivering historic tax relief for the american people ! #taxcutsandjobsact
together , we are making america great again !
i would like to congratulate @senatemajldr on having done a fantastic job both strategically & politically on the passing in the senate of the massive tax cut & reform bill . i could have not asked for a better or more talented partner . our team will go onto many more victories!
the tax cuts are so large and so meaningful , and yet the fake news is working overtime to follow the lead of their friends , the defeated dems , and only demean . this is truly a case where the results will speak for themselves , starting very soon . jobs , jobs , jobs!
the united states senate just passed the biggest in history tax cut and reform bill . terrible individual mandate obamacarerepealed . goes to the house tomorrow morning for final vote . if approved , there will be a news conference at the white house at approximately 1:00 
congratulations to paul ryan , kevin mccarthy , kevin brady , steve scalise , cathy mcmorris rodgers and all great house republicans who voted in favor of cutting your taxes!
a story in the @washingtonpost that i was close to rescinding the nomination of justice gorsuch prior to confirmation is fake news . i never even wavered and am very proud of him and the job he is doing as a justice of the u . s. supreme court . the unnamed sources don’t exist!
stocks and the economy have a long way to go after the tax cut bill is totally understood and appreciated in scope and size . immediate expensing will have a big impact . biggest tax cuts and reform ever passed . enjoy , and create many beautiful jobs!
dow rises 5000 points on the year for the first time ever - make america great again!
together , our task is to strengthen our families , to build up our communities , to serve our citizens , and to celebrate american greatness as a shining example to the world .
with the strategy that i announced today , we are declaring that america is in the game and america is determined to win ! our four pillars of national security strategy:
70 record closes for the dow so far this year ! we have never had 70 dow records in a one year period . wow!
thank you maria b !
so true ivanka !
as the world watches , we are days away from passing historic tax cuts for american families and businesses . it will be the biggest tax cut and tax reform in the history of our country !
when the american people speak , all of us should listen . just over one year ago , you spoke loud and clear . on november 8, 2016, you voted to make america great again !
over the past 11 months , i have travelled tens of thousands of miles , to visit 13 countries . i have met with more than 100 world leaders and everywhere i traveled , it was my highest privilege and greatest honor to represent the american people !
our deepest sympathies and most heartfelt prayers are with the victims of the train derailment in washington state . we are closely monitoring the situation and coordinating with local authorities .
my thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved in the train accident in dupont , washington . thank you to all of our wonderful first responders who are on the scene . we are currently monitoring here at the white house.
the train accident that just occurred in dupont , wa shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly . seven trillion dollars spent in the middle east while our roads , bridges , tunnels , railways and more crumble ! not for long!
ivanka trump will be interviewed on @foxandfriends.
remember , republicans are 5-0 in congressional races this year . the media refuses to mention this . i said gillespie and moore would lose for very different reasons , and they did . i also predicted i would win . republicans will do well in 2018, very well ! @foxandfriends
more than a century after conquering flight , the #wrightbrothers continue to motivate & inspire americans , who never tire of exploration & innovation . this great american spirit can be found in the design of every new supersonic jet and next generation:
wonderful weekend at camp david . a very special place . a lot of very important work done . heading back to the @whitehouse now .
as a candidate , i promised we would pass a massive tax cut for the everyday working american families who are the backbone and the heartbeat of our country . now , we are just days away .
weekly address🇺🇸
tax cuts will increase investment in the american economy and in u . s. workers , leading to higher growth , higher wages , and more jobs !
congratulations to two great and hardworking guys , corey lewandowski and david bossie , on the success of their just out book , let trump be trump . finally people with real knowledge are writing about our wonderful and exciting campaign!
great job kevin , we are all proud of you !
dow , s&p 500 and nasdaq close at record highs ! #maga
today , it was my tremendous honor to visit marine helicopter squadron one hmx-1 at the marine corps air facility in quantico , virginia . i am honored to serve as your commander-in-chief . on behalf of an entire nation , thank you for your sacrifice and service . we love you !
you are always there for us – the men and women in blue . thank you to our police , thank you to our sheriffs , and thank you to our law enforcement families . god bless you all , and god bless america ! #lesm
to each member of the graduating class from the national academy at quantico , congratulations !
it was my honor . thank you !
manufacturing optimism rose to another all-time high in the latest @shopfloornam outlook survey
in 1960, there were approximately 20,000 pages in the code of federal regulations . today there are over 185,000 pages , as seen in the roosevelt room . today , we cut the red tape ! it is time to set free our dreams and make america great again !
when americans are free to thrive , innovate , & prosper , there is no challenge too great , no task too large , & no goal beyond our reach . we are a nation of explorers , pioneers , innovators & inventors . we are nation of people who work hard , dream big , & who never , ever give up .
today , we gathered in the roosevelt room for one single reason: to cut the red tape ! for many decades , an ever-growing maze of regs , rules , and restrictions has cost our country trillions of dollars , millions of jobs , countless american factories , & devastated entire industries .
as a candidate , i promised we would pass a massive tax cut for the everyday , working americans . if you make your voices heard , this moment will be forever remembered as a great new beginning – the dawn of a brilliant american future shining with patriotism , prosperity and pride !
republican tax cuts are looking very good . all are working hard . in the meantime , the stock market hit another record high!
thank you omarosa for your service ! i wish you continued success.
if last night’s election proved anything , it proved that we need to put up great republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the house and senate.
wow , more than 90% of fake news media coverage of me is negative , with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories . hence my use of social media , the only way to get the truth out . much of mainstream meadia has become a joke ! @foxandfriends
the reason i originally endorsed luther strange and his numbers went up mightily , is that i said roy moore will not be able to win the general election . i was right ! roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!
congratulations to doug jones on a hard fought victory . the write-in votes played a very big factor , but a win is a win . the people of alabama are great , and the republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time . it never ends!
wishing all of those celebrating #hanukkah around the world a happy and healthy eight nights in the company of those they love .
consumer confidence is at an all-time high , along with a record high stock market . unemployment is at a 17 year low . make america great again ! working to pass massive tax cuts looking good.
the people of alabama will do the right thing . doug jones is pro-abortion , weak on crime , military and illegal immigration , bad for gun owners and veterans and against the wall . jones is a pelosi/schumer puppet . roy moore will always vote with us . vote roy moore!
lightweight senator kirsten gillibrand , a total flunky for chuck schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago and would do anything for them , is now in the ring fighting against trump . very disloyal to bill & crooked-used!
despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent , the democrats have been unable to show any collusion with russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who i don’t know and/or have never met . fake news!
another false story , this time in the failing @nytimes , that i watch 4-8 hours of television a day - wrong ! also , i seldom , if ever , watch cnn or msnbc , both of which i consider fake news . i never watch don lemon , who i once called the dumbest man on television ! bad reporting.
very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the fake news media . they are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them . major lies written , then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed . a stain on america!
getting closer and closer on the tax cut bill . shaping up even better than projected . house and senate working very hard and smart . end result will be not only important , but special!
things are going really well for our economy , a subject the fake news spends as little time as possible discussing ! stock market hit another record high , unemployment is now at a 17 year low and companies are coming back into the usa . really good news , and much more to come!
no american should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country . our cities should be sanctuaries for americans – not for criminal aliens !
great army - navy game . army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the commander-in-chief’s trophy ! congratulations!
great army - navy game . army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the commander-in-chief’s trophy last time was 1996. wow ! congratulations!
@daveweigel of the washington post just admitted that his picture was a fake fraud ? showing an almost empty arena last night for my speech in pensacola when , in fact , he knew the arena was packed as shown also on t . v. fake news , he should be fired.
@daveweigel @washingtonpost put out a phony photo of an empty arena hours before i arrived @ the venue , w/ thousands of people outside , on their way in . real photos now shown as i spoke . packed house , many people unable to get in . demand apology & retraction from fake news wapo !
have a great game today , @usarmy and @usnavy - i will be watching . we love our u . s. military . on behalf of an entire nation , thank you for your sacrifice and service ! #armynavygame #usa🇺🇸
it was my great honor to celebrate the opening of two extraordinary museums-the mississippi state history museum & the mississippi civil rights museum . we pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past & dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom , equality , justice & peace .
heading to the great state of mississippi at the invitation of their popular and respected governor , @philbryantms . look forward to seeing the new civil rights museum!
cnn’s slogan is cnn , the most trusted name in news . everyone knows this is not true , that this could , in fact , be a fraud on the american public . there are many outlets that are far more trusted than fake news cnn . their slogan should be cnn , the least trusted name in news!
fake news cnn made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday . they were caught red handed , just like lonely brian ross at abc news who should be immediately fired for his mistake . watch to see if @cnn fires those responsible , or was it just gross incompetence?
a big contingent of very enthusiastic roy moore fans at the rally last night . we can’t have a pelosi/schumer liberal democrat , jones , in that important alabama senate seat . need your vote to make america great again ! jones will always vote against what we must do for our country.
great evening last night in pensacola , florida . arena was packed to the rafters , the crowd was loud , loving and really smart . they definitely get what’s going on . thank you pensacola!
we believe that every american should stand for the national anthem , and we proudly pledge allegiance to one nation under god !
this is your land , this is your home , and its your voice that matters the most . so speak up , be heard , and fight , fight , fight for the change youve been waiting for your entire life ! merry christmas and thank you pensacola , florida !
just arrived at the pensacola bay center . join me live on @foxnews in 10 minutes ! #maga
on my way to pensacola , florida . see everyone soon ! #maga
the unemployment rate remains at a 17-year low of 4.1% . the unemployment rate in manufacturing dropped to 2.6% , the lowest ever recorded . the unemployment rate among hispanics dropped to 4.7% , the lowest ever recorded . @secretaryacosta @usdol
make america great again !
fines and penalties against wells fargo bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped , as has incorrectly been reported , but will be pursued and , if anything , substantially increased . i will cut regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!
last thing the make america great again agenda needs is a liberal democrat in senate where we have so little margin for victory already . the pelosi/schumer puppet jones would vote against us 100% of the time . he’s bad on crime , life , border , vets , guns & military . vote roy moore!
big crowd expected today in pensacola , florida , for a make america great again speech . we have done so much in so short a period of time . and yet are planning to do so much more ! see you there!
i fulfilled my campaign promise - others didn’t !
tonight , @flotus melania and i were thrilled to welcome so many wonderful friends to the @whitehouse – and wish them all a very #happyhanukkah
across the battlefields , oceans , and harrowing skies of europe and the pacific throughout the war , one great battle cry could be heard by america’s friends and foes alike: remember pearl harbor .
today , as we remember pearl harbor , it was an incredible honor to be joined with surviving veterans of the attack on 12/7/1941. they are heroes , and they are living witnesses to american history . all american hearts are filled with gratitude for their service and their sacrifice .
today , the u . s. flag flies at half-staff at the @whitehouse , in honor of national pearl harbor remembrance day .
today , our entire nation pauses to remember pearl harbor—and the brave warriors who on that day stood tall and fought for america . god bless our heroes who wear the uniform , and god bless the united states of america . #pearlharborremembranceday🇺🇸
national pearl harbor remembrance day - a day that will live in infamy ! december 7, 1941
go get the new book on andrew jackson by brian kilmeade . really good . @foxandfriends
i have determined that it is time to officially recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel . i am also directing the state department to begin preparation to move the american embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem .
join me live from the @whitehouse via #periscope
our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the path of california’s wildfires . i encourage everyone to heed the advice and orders of local and state officials . thank you to all first responders for your incredible work !
make america great again!
join me this friday in pensacola , florida at the pensacola bay center ! tickets:
yesterday , i was thrilled to be with so many wonderful friends , in utah’s magnificent capitol . it was my honor to sign two presidential proclamations that will modify the national monuments designations of both bears ears and grand staircase escalante .
a must watch: legal scholar alan dershowitz was just on @foxandfriends talking of what is going on with respect to the greatest witch hunt in u . s. political history . enjoy!
with the great vote on cutting taxes , this could be a big day for the stock market - and you!
putting pelosi/schumer liberal puppet jones into office in alabama would hurt our great republican agenda of low on taxes , tough on crime , strong on military and borders . & so much more . look at your 401-k’s since election . highest stock market ever ! jobs are roaring back!
democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive tax cuts is why we need republican roy moore to win in alabama . we need his vote on stopping crime , illegal immigration , border wall , military , pro life , v . a. , judges 2nd amendment and more . no to jones , a pelosi/schumer puppet!
report: anti-trump fbi agent led clinton email probe now it all starts to make sense!
people who lost money when the stock market went down 350 points based on the false and dishonest reporting of brian ross of @abc news he has been suspended , should consider hiring a lawyer and suing abc for the damages this bad reporting has caused - many millions of dollars!
after years of comey , with the phony and dishonest clinton investigation and more , running the fbi , its reputation is in tatters - worst in history ! but fear not , we will bring it back to greatness.
tainted no , very dishonest ? fbi agent’s role in clinton probe under review . led clinton email probe . @foxandfriends clinton money going to wife of another fbi agent in charge.
such a total miscarriage of justice in san francisco !
i never asked comey to stop investigating flynn . just more fake news covering another comey lie!
congratulations to @abc news for suspending brian ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the russia , russia , russia witch hunt . more networks and papers should do the same with their fake news!
many people in our country are asking what the justice department is going to do about the fact that totally crooked hillary , after receiving a subpoena from the united states congress , deleted and acid washed 33,000 emails ? no justice!
so general flynn lies to the fbi and his life is destroyed , while crooked hillary clinton , on that now famous fbi holiday interrogation with no swearing in and no recording , lies many times . and nothing happens to her ? rigged system , or just a double standard?
great job first lady melania !
62 years ago this week , a brave seamstress in montgomery , alabama uttered one word that changed history .
i had to fire general flynn because he lied to the vice president and the fbi . he has pled guilty to those lies . it is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful . there was nothing to hide!
biggest tax bill and tax cuts in history just passed in the senate . now these great republicans will be going for final passage . thank you to house and senate republicans for your hard work and commitment!
we are one step closer to delivering massive tax cuts for working families across america . special thanks to @senatemajldr mitch mcconnell and chairman @senorrinhatch for shepherding our bill through the senate . look forward to signing a final bill before christmas !
economists on the tax cuts and jobs act: the enactment of a comprehensive overhaul - complete with a lower corporate tax rate - will ignite our economy with levels of growth not seen in generations .
the media has been speculating that i fired rex tillerson or that he would be leaving soon - fake news ! he’s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects , i call the final shots we work well together and america is highly respected again !
republicans senators are working hard to pass the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country . the bill is getting better and better . this is a once in a generation chance . obstructionist dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit!
the jury was not told the killer of kate was a 7 time felon . the schumer/pelosi democrats are so weak on crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 elections.
the kate steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected obama border , always committing crimes and being violent , and yet this info was not used in court . his exoneration is a complete travesty of justice . build the wall!
a disgraceful verdict in the kate steinle case ! no wonder the people of our country are so angry with illegal immigration.
the christmas story begins 2,000 years ago with a mother , a father , their baby son and the most extraordinary gift of all—the gift of god’s love for all of humanity . whatever our beliefs , we know that the birth of jesus christ and the story of his life .
today is a day that i’ve been looking very much forward to all year long . it is one that you have heard me speak about many times before . now , as president of the united states , it is my tremendous honor to finally wish america and the world , a very merry christmas !
our fifth 1k milestone of 2017! #dow24k #maga
today , it was my great honor to meet with the crown prince of bahrain at the @whitehouse . bahrain and the united states are important partners . during the crown prince’s visit , he is advancing $9 billion in commercial deals , including finalizing the purchase of f-16’s .
thank you @senorrinhatch . let’s continue making america great again !
the dow just broke 24,000 for the first time another all-time record . if the dems had won the presidential election , the market would be down 50% from these levels and consumer confidence , which is also at an all-time high , would be low and glum!
stock market hits new record high . confidence and enthusiasm abound . more great numbers coming out!
the chinese envoy , who just returned from north korea , seems to have had no impact on little rocket man . hard to believe his people , and the military , put up with living in such horrible conditions . russia and china condemned the launch.
the failing @nytimes has totally gone against the social media guidelines that they installed to preserve some credibility after many of their biased reporters went rogue ! @foxandfriends
the failing @nytimes , the pipe organ for the democrat party , has become a virtual lobbyist for them with regard to our massive tax cut bill . they are wrong so often that now i know we have a winner!
funny to hear the democrats talking about the national debt when president obama doubled it in only 8 years!
had the information crooked hillary’s emails been released there would have been harm to national security . charles mccullough fmr intel comm inspector general
the only people who don’t like the tax cut bill are the people that don’t understand it or the obstructionist democrats that know how really good it is and do not want the credit and success to go to the republicans!
the house of representatives seeks contempt citations ? against the justicedepartment and the fbi for withholding key documents and an fbi witness which could shed light on surveillance of associates of donald trump . big stuff . deep state . give this information now ! @foxnews
@theresa_may , don’t focus on me , focus on the destructive radical islamic terrorism that is taking place within the united kingdom . we are doing just fine!
theresa @theresamay , don’t focus on me , focus on the destructive radical islamic terrorism that is taking place within the united kingdom . we are doing just fine!
now , we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to restore american prosperity – and reclaim america’s destiny . but in order to achieve this bright and glowing future , the senate must pass tax cuts – and bring main street roaring back to life !
a vote to cut taxes is a vote to put america first . it is time to take care of our workers , to protect our communities , and to rebuild our great country !
this week , the senate can join the house & take a strong stand for the middle class families who are the backbone of america . together , we will give the american people a big , beautiful christmas present-a massive tax cut that lets americans keep more of their hard-earned money !
departing @jba_nafw for st . charles , missouri to help push our plan for historic tax cuts across the finish line . a successful vote in the senate this week will bring us one giant step closer to delivering an incredible victory for the american people !
economy growing ! excluding hurricane effects , cea estimates that real gdp growth would have been 3.9% in q3. stock market at a new high , unemployment at a low . we are winning and tax cuts will shift our economy into high gear !
just spoke to president xi jinping of china concerning the provocative actions of north korea . additional major sanctions will be imposed on north korea today . this situation will be handled!
so now that matt lauer is gone when will the fake news practitioners at nbc be terminating the contract of phil griffin ? and will they terminate low ratings joe scarborough based on the unsolved mystery that took place in florida years ago ? investigate!
so now tha matt lauer is gone when will the fake news practitioners at nbc be terminating the contract of phil griffin ? and will they terminate low ratings joe scarborough based on the unsolved mystery that took place in florida years ago ? investigate!
wow , matt lauer was just fired from nbc for inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace . but when will the top executives at nbc & comcast be fired for putting out so much fake news . check out andy lack’s past!
looks like another great day for the stock market . consumer confidence is at record high . i guess somebody likes me my policies!
great , and we should boycott fake news cnn . dealing with them is a total waste of time !
@foxandfriends , we are in record territory in all things having to do with our economy !
great day for tax cuts and the republican party . but the biggest winner will be our great country!
great work ivanka !
just won the lawsuit on leadership of consumer financial protection bureau , cfpb . a big win for the consumer!
charles mccullough , the respected fmr intel comm inspector general , said public was misled on crooked hillary emails . emails endangered national security . why aren’t our deep state authorities looking at this ? rigged & corrupt ? @tuckercarlson @seanhannity
after north korea missile launch , its more important than ever to fund our govt & military ! dems shouldnt hold troop funding hostage for amnesty & illegal immigration . i ran on stopping illegal immigration and won big . they cant now threaten a shutdown to get their demands.
the conference board said that consumer sentiment was at its highest level in nearly 17 years in november . the consumer confidence index rose from 126.2 in october to 129.5, notching its best reading since december 2000.
dow , s&p 500 and nasdaq all finished the day at new record highs !
remarks from the roosevelt room with @senatemajldr mitch mcconnell , @speakerryan and secretary of defense , general james mattis .
statement from president donald j . trump on #givingtuesday
meeting with chuck and nancy today about keeping government open and working . problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our country unchecked , are weak on crime and want to substantially raise taxes . i don’t see a deal!
melania , our great and very hard working first lady , who truly loves what she is doing , always thought that if you run , you will win . she would tell everyone that , no doubt , he will win . i also felt i would win or i would not have run - and country is doing great!
at least 24 players kneeling this weekend at nfl stadiums that are now having a very hard time filling up . the american public is fed up with the disrespect the nfl is paying to our country , our flag and our national anthem . weak and out of control!
thank you rand !
new home sales reach a 10 year high . stock market has more record gains . hopefully republican senators will give us the much needed tax cuts to keep it all going ! democrats want big tax increases.
the tax cut bill is coming along very well , great support . with just a few changes , some mathematical , the middle class and job producers can get even more in actual dollars and savings and the pass through provision becomes simpler and really works well!
the good news is that their ratings are terrible , nobody cares !
we should have a contest as to which of the networks , plus cnn and not including fox , is the most dishonest , corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite president me . they are all bad . winner to receive the fake news trophy!
back in DC , big week for tax cuts and many other things of great importance to our country . senate republicans will hopefully come through for all of us . the tax cut bill is getting better and better . the end result will be great for all!
since the first day i took office , all you hear is the phony democrat excuse for losing the election , russia , russia , russia . despite this i have the economy booming and have possibly done more than any 10 month president . make america great again!
i endorsed luther strange in the alabama primary . he shot way up in the polls but it wasn’t enough . can’t let schumer/pelosi win this race . liberal jones would be bad!
the last thing we need in alabama and the u . s. senate is a schumer/pelosi puppet who is weak on crime , weak on the border , bad for our military and our great vets , bad for our 2nd amendment , and wants to raises taxes to the sky . jones would be a disaster!
wow , even i didn’t realize we did so much . wish the fake news would report ! thank you .
@foxnews is much more important in the united states than cnn , but outside of the u . s. , cnn international is still a major source of fake news , and they represent our nation to the world very poorly . the outside world does not see the truth from them!
check out the recent editorial in the wall street journal @wsj about what a complete disaster the @cfpb has been under its leader from previous administration , who just quit!
the consumer financial protection bureau , or cfpb , has been a total disaster as run by the previous administrations pick . financial institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public . we will bring it back to life!
happy #smallbusinesssaturday ! a great day to support your community and america’s job creators by shopping locally at a #smallbiz . #shopsmall
time magazine called to say that i was probably going to be named man person of the year , like last year , but i would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot . i said probably is no good and took a pass . thanks anyway!

will be speaking to president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey this morning about bringing peace to the mess that i inherited in the middle east . i will get it all done , but what a mistake , in lives and dollars 6 trillion , to be there in the first place!
can you believe that the disrespect for our country , our flag , our anthem continues without penalty to the players . the commissioner has lost control of the hemorrhaging league . players are the boss !
two great people !
a great guy with great ratings !
obamacare premiums are going up , up , up , just as i have been predicting for two years . obamacare is owned by the democrats , and it is a disaster . but do not worry . even though the dems want to obstruct , we will repeal & replace right after tax cuts!

another crooked hillary fan !
the nfl is now thinking about a new idea - keeping teams in the locker room during the national anthem next season . that’s almost as bad as kneeling ! when will the highly paid commissioner finally get tough and smart ? this issue is killing your league ! .
lavar , you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during thanksgiving with your son in china , but no nba contract to support you . but remember lavar , shoplifting is not a little thing . it’s a really big deal , especially in china . ungrateful fool!
it wasn’t the white house , it wasn’t the state department , it wasn’t father lavar’s so-called people on the ground in china that got his son out of a long term prison sentence - it was me . too bad ! lavar is just a poor man’s version of don king , but without the hair . just think.
today , we continued a wonderful american tradition at the white house . drumstick and wishbone will live out their days in the beautiful blue ridge mountains at gobbler’s rest .
president donald j . trump and @flotus melania participate in the pardoning of the national thanksgiving turkey at the white house .
under president trump unemployment rate will drop below 4% . analysts predict economic boom for 2018! @foxandfriends and @varneyco
marshawn lynch of the nfl’s oakland raiders stands for the mexican anthem and sits down to boos for our national anthem . great disrespect ! next time nfl should suspend him for remainder of season . attendance and ratings way down.
republican senators are working very hard to get tax cuts and tax reform approved . hopefully it will not be long and they do not want to disappoint the american public!
border patrol officer killed at southern border , another badly hurt . we will seek out and bring to justice those responsible . we will , and must , build the wall!
big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of elephants or any other animal.
shoplifting is a very big deal in china , as it should be 5-10 years in jail , but not to father lavar . should have gotten his son out during my next trip to china instead . china told them why they were released . very ungrateful!
sen . jeff flakey , who is unelectable in the great state of arizona quit race , anemic polls was caught purposely on mike saying bad things about your favorite president . he’ll be a no on tax cuts because his political career anyway is toast.
now that the three basketball players are out of china and saved from years in jail , lavar ball , the father of liangelo , is unaccepting of what i did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal . i should have left them in jail!
crooked hillary clinton is the worst and biggest loser of all time . she just can’t stop , which is so good for the republican party . hillary , get on with your life and give it another try in three years!
put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as i review all conservation facts . under study for years . will update soon with secretary zinke . thank you!
today , it was an honor to celebrate the collegiate national champions of 2016/2017 at the @whitehouse ! #ncaachampions🏆photos:
together , were going to restore safety to our streets and peace to our communities , and were going to destroy the vile criminal cartel , #ms13, and many other gangs . hundreds arrested in ms-13 crackdown
if democrats were not such obstructionists and understood the power of lower taxes , we would be able to get many of their ideas into bill!
great numbers on stocks and the economy . if we get tax cuts and reform , well really see some great results!
and to think that just last week he was lecturing anyone who would listen about sexual harassment and respect for women . lesley stahl tape?
the al frankenstien picture is really bad , speaks a thousand words . where do his hands go in pictures 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 while she sleeps ? .
big win today in the house for gop tax cuts and reform , 227-205. zero dems , they want to raise taxes much higher , but not for our military!
congratulations to the house of representatives for passing the #taxcutsandjobsact — a big step toward fulfilling our promise to deliver historic tax cuts for the american people by the end of the year !

to the three ucla basketball players i say: youre welcome , go out and give a big thank you to president xi jinping of china who made.
big vote tomorrow in the house . tax cuts are getting close!
why are democrats fighting massive tax cuts for the middle class and business jobs ? the reason: obstruction and delay!
it is actually hard to believe how naive or dumb the failing @nytimes is when it comes to foreign policy . weak and ineffective!
they should realize that these relationships are a good thing , not a bad thing . the u . s. is being respected again . watch trade!
the failing @nytimes hates the fact that i have developed a great relationship with world leaders like xi jinping , president of china.
do you think the three ucla basketball players will say thank you president trump ? they were headed for 10 years in jail!
thank you !
thank you , working hard !
while in the philippines i was forced to watch @cnn , which i have not done in months , and again realized how bad , and fake , it is . loser!

i will be making a major statement from the @whitehouse upon my return to DC time and date to be set.
just arrived at #asean50 in the philippines for my final stop with world leaders . will lead to fair trade deals , unlike the horror shows from past administrations . will then be leaving for DC made many good friends!
after my tour of asia , all countries dealing with us on trade know that the rules have changed . the united states has to be treated fairly and in a reciprocal fashion . the massive trade deficits must go down quickly!
great to see @randpaul looking well and back on the senate floor . he will help us with tax cuts and reform!
excited to be heading home to see the house pass a great tax bill with the middle class getting big tax cuts ! #makeamericagreatagain🇺🇸
i am proud of the rep . house & senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform . } we’re getting close ! now , how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular indiv mandate in ocare & reducing taxes even further ? cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?
happy to announce , i am nominating alex azar to be the next hhs secretary . he will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!

why would kim jong-un insult me by calling me old , when i would never call him short and fat ? oh well , i try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!
does the fake news media remember when crooked hillary clinton , as secretary of state , was begging russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button ? obama tried also , but he had zero chemistry with putin.
when will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with russia is a good thing , not a bad thing . there always playing politics - bad for our country . i want to solve north korea , syria , ukraine , terrorism , and russia can greatly help!
met with president putin of russia who was at #apec meetings . good discussions on syria . hope for his help to solve , along with china the dangerous north korea crisis . progress being made.

my meetings with president xi jinping were very productive on both trade and the subject of north korea . he is a highly respected and powerful representative of his people . it was great being with him and madame peng liyuan!
i don’t blame china , i blame the incompetence of past admins for allowing china to take advantage of the u . s. on trade leading up to a point where the u . s. is losing $100s of billions . how can you blame china for taking advantage of people that had no clue ? i wouldve done same!
in the coming months and years ahead i look forward to building an even stronger relationship between the united states and china . 🇺🇸🇨🇳

together , we dream of a korea that is free , a peninsula that is safe , and families that are reunited once again !
anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the u . s. should look to our past . and you will doubt it no longer .
the north korean regime has pursued its nuclear & ballistic missile programs in defiance of every assurance , agreement , & commmitment it has made to the u . s. and its allies . its broken all of those commitments .
the u . s. , under my administration , is completely rebuilding its military , and theyre spending hundreds of billions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world , being built right now . i want peace through strength !
join me live in south korea🇺🇸🇰🇷 #nationalassembly #potusinasia ➡

the rigged dem primary , one of the biggest political stories in years , got zero coverage on fake news network tv last night . disgraceful!
just took off for ceremony @ pearl harbor . will then be heading to japan , skorea , china , vietnam & the philippines . will never let you down!
i always felt i would be running and winning against bernie sanders , not crooked h , without cheating , i was right.
bernie sanders supporters have every right to be apoplectic of the complete theft of the dem primary by crooked hillary!
based on that , the military has hit isis much harder over the last two days . they will pay a big price for every attack on us!
isis just claimed the degenerate animal who killed , and so badly wounded , the wonderful people on the west side , was their soldier . .
pocahontas just stated that the democrats , lead by the legendary crooked hillary clinton , rigged the primaries ! lets go fbi & justice dept.
the real story on collusion is in donna bs new book . crooked hillary bought the dnc & then stole the democratic primary from crazy bernie!
people are angry . at some point the justice department , and the fbi , must do what is right and proper . the american public deserves it!
new donna b book says she paid for and stole the dem primary . what about the deleted e-mails , uranium , podesta , the server , plus , plus.
everybody is asking why the justice department and fbi isnt looking into all of the dishonesty going on with crooked hillary & the dems.
my twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee . i guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact.
i will be interviewed by @ingrahamangle on @foxnews at 10:00. enjoy!
the @tuckercarlson opening statement about our once cherished and great fbi was so sad to watch . james comeys leadership was a disaster!
this is real collusion and dishonesty . major violation of campaign finance laws and money laundering - where is our justice department?
donna brazile just stated the dnc rigged the system to illegally steal the primary from bernie sanders . bought and paid for by crooked h.

there is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed . should move fast . death penalty!
would love to send the nyc terrorist to guantanamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the federal system.
nyc terrorist was happy as he asked to hang isis flag in his hospital room . he killed 8 people , badly injured 12. should get death penalty!
great mtg w/ @cabinet today . tomorrow , i will be announcing the new head of the fed . i think you will be extremely impressed by this person !
happy birthday to @garyplayer , a truly great champion and person!

just spoke with @nygovcuomo and @nycmayor de blasio to let them know that the federal government.
we mourn the horrifying terrorist attack in nyc . all of america is praying and grieving for the families who lost their precious loved ones .
for the middle class . the house and senate should consider asap as the process of final approval moves along . push biggest tax cuts ever
wouldnt it be great to repeal the very unfair and unpopular individual mandate in obamacare and use those savings for further tax cuts.
#nycstrong #usa🇺🇸
senator chuck schumer helping to import europes problems said col . tony shaffer . we will stop this craziness ! @foxandfriends
we are fighting hard for merit based immigration , no more democrat lottery systems . we must get much tougher and smarter . @foxandfriends
the terrorist came into our country through what is called the diversity visa lottery program , a chuck schumer beauty . i want merit based.
i have just ordered homeland security to step up our already extreme vetting program . being politically correct is fine , but not for this!
the republican house members are working hard and late toward the massive tax cuts that they know you deserve . these will be biggest ever!
my thoughts , condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the new york city terrorist attack . god and your country are with you!
we must not allow isis to return , or enter , our country after defeating them in the middle east and elsewhere . enough!
in nyc , looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person . law enforcement is following this closely . not in the u . s.a . !

statement by president trump on the apprehension of mustafa al-imam for his alleged role in benghazi attacks
earth shattering . he and his brother could drain the swamp , which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled . fake news weak!
the biggest story yesterday , the one that has the dems in a dither , is podesta running from his firm . what he know about crooked dems is.
i hope people will start to focus on our massive tax cuts for business jobs and the middle class in addition to democrat corruption!
came to the campaign . few people knew the young , low level volunteer named george , who has already proven to be a liar . check the dems!
the fake news is working overtime . as paul manaforts lawyer said , there was no collusion and events mentioned took place long before he.
also , there is no collusion!
sorry , but this is years ago , before paul manafort was part of the trump campaign . but why arent crooked hillary & the dems the focus ? ?? ? ?
great job by michaelcaputo on @foxandfriends.
report out that obama campaign paid $972,000 to fusion gps . the firm also got $12,400,000 really ? from dnc . nobody knows who okd!
all of this russia talk right when the republicans are making their big push for historic tax cuts & reform . is this coincidental ? not!
are now fighting back like never before . there is so much guilt by democrats/clinton , and now the facts are pouring out . do something!
collusion , which doesnt exist . the dems are using this terrible and bad for our country witch hunt for evil politics , but the rs.
the uranium to russia deal , the 33,000 plus deleted emails , the comey fix and so much more . instead they look at phony trump/russia , .
never seen such republican anger & unity as i have concerning the lack of investigation on clinton made fake dossier now $12,000,000? , .
as usual , the obamacare premiums will be up the dems own it , but we will repeal & replace and have great healthcare soon after tax cuts!
jfk files are released , long ahead of schedule!

as it has turned out , james comey lied and leaked and totally protected hillary clinton . he was the best thing that ever happened to her!
the democrats will only vote for tax increases . hopefully , all senate republicans will vote for the largest tax cuts in u . s. history.
people not interviewed , including clinton herself . comey stated under oath that he didnt do this-obviously a fix ? where is justice dept?

fake @nbcnews made up a story that i wanted a tenfold increase in our u . s. nuclear arsenal . pure fiction , made up to demean . nbc = cnn!
it is about time that roger goodell of the nfl is finally demanding that all players stand for our great national anthem-respect our country
the democrats want massive tax increases & soft , crime producing borders . the republicans want the biggest tax cut in history & the wall!
it would be really nice if the fake news media would report the virtually unprecedented stock market growth since the election . need tax cuts
if congress gives us the massive tax cuts and reform i am asking for , those numbers will grow by leaps and bounds . #maga

highly respected author , christopher bedford , just came out with book , the art of the donald , lessons from americas . really good book!
with jemele hill at the mike , it is no wonder espn ratings have tanked , in fact , tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!
since congress cant get its act together on healthcare , i will be using the power of the pen to give great healthcare to many people - fast
the problem with agreeing to a policy on immigration is that the democrats dont want secure borders , they dont care about safety for u . s.a.
why is the nfl getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our anthem , flag and country ? change tax law!
we have just begun !
a big salute to jerry jones , owner of the dallas cowboys , who will bench players who disrespect our flag . stand for anthem or sit for game!
president donald j . trump proclaims october 9, 2017, as #columbusday
the trip by @vp pence was long planned . he is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!
our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with north korea for 25 years , giving billions of dollars & getting nothing . policy didnt work!
the republican party is racking up record amounts of small dollar donations - fueled by trump supporters . @nypost thank you!
nobody could have done what i’ve done for #puertorico with so little appreciation . so much work !
bob corker gave us the iran deal , & thats about it . we need healthcare , we need tax cuts/reform , we need people that can get the job done!
fema and first responders are working hard yet again on hurricane nate . military helping . very much under control!
i asked @vp pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled , disrespecting our country . i am proud of him and @secondlady karen.
hence , i would fully expect corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda . didnt have the guts to run!
my endorsement . he also wanted to be secretary of state , i said no thanks . he is also largely responsible for the horrendous iran deal!
senator bob corker begged me to endorse him for re-election in tennessee . i said no and he dropped out said he could not win without.

@nbcnews is so knowingly inaccurate with their reporting . the good news is that the people get it , which is really all that matters ! not #1
i called chuck schumer yesterday to see if the dems want to do a great healthcare bill . obamacare is badly broken , big premiums . who knows!
more and more people are suggesting that republicans and me should be given equal time on t . v. when you look at the one-sided coverage?
late night host are dealing with the democrats for their very unfunny & repetitive material , always anti-trump ! should we get equal time?
contributions . the rnc is taking in far more $s than the dems , and much of it by my wonderful small donors . i am working hard for them!
cant believe i finally got a good story in the @washingtonpost . it discusses the enthusiasm of trump voters through campaign.
ralph northam , who is running for governor of virginia , is fighting for the violent ms-13 killer gangs & sanctuary cities . vote ed gillespie!
rex tillerson never threatened to resign . this is fake news put out by @nbcnews . low news and reporting standards . no verification from me.
stock market hits an all-time high ! unemployment lowest in 16 years ! business and manufacturing enthusiasm at highest level in decades!
why isnt the senate intel committee looking into the fake news networks in our country to see why so much of our news is just made up-fake!

i will be landing in las vegas shortly to pay my respects with @flotus melania . everyone remains in our thoughts and prayers.
the @nbcnews story has just been totally refuted by sec . tillerson and @vp pence . it is #fakenews . they should issue an apology to america!
nbc news is #fakenews and more dishonest than even cnn . they are a disgrace to good reporting . no wonder their news ratings are way down!
wow , so many fake news stories today . no matter what i do or say , they will not write or speak truth . the fake news media is out of control!
a great day in puerto rico yesterday . while some of the news coverage is fake , most showed great warmth and friendship.
my administration will continue to work around the clock with governor @ricardorossello & his team . great progress being made ! #prstrong🇵🇷

the fake news networks are working overtime in puerto rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first rs . shame!
i will be going to puerto rico on tuesday with melania . will hopefully be able to stop at the u . s. virgin islands people working hard.
fake news cnn and nbc are going out of their way to disparage our great first responders as a way to get trump . not fair to fr or effort!
the military and first responders , despite no electric , roads , phones etc . , have done an amazing job . puerto rico was totally destroyed.
want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort . 10,000 federal workers now on island doing a fantastic job.
such poor leadership ability by the mayor of san juan , and others in puerto rico , who are not able to get their workers to help . they.
the mayor of san juan , who was very complimentary only a few days ago , has now been told by the democrats that you must be nasty to trump.

this is the right tax cut @ the right time . we will all succeed & grow together – as one team , one people , & one american family . #taxreform
just arrived in indianapolis , indiana to make an announcement on #taxreform ! together , we are going to make america great again !
but the people were pro-trump ! virtually no president has accomplished what we have accomplished in the first 9 months-and economy roaring
facebook was always anti-trump . the networks were always anti-trump hence , fake news , @nytimesapologized & @wapo were anti-trump . collusion?
we will have the votes for healthcare but not for the reconciliation deadline of friday , after which we need 60. get rid of filibuster rule!

alabama , get out and vote for luther strange - he has proven to me that he will never let you down ! #maga
the nfl has all sorts of rules and regulations . the only way out for them is to set a rule that you cant kneel during our national anthem!
thank you to carmen yulin cruz , the mayor of san juan , for your kind words on fema etc . we are working hard . much food and water there/on way
great interview on @foxandfriends with the parents of otto warmbier: 1994 - 2017. otto was tortured beyond belief by north korea.
luther strange has been shooting up in the alabama polls since my endorsement . finish the job - vote today for big luther.
but while dallas dropped to its knees as a team , they all stood up for our national anthem . big progress being made-we all love our country!
but while dallas dropped to it knees as a team , they all stood up for our national anthem . big progress being made - we love our country!
the booing at the nfl football game last night , when the entire dallas team dropped to its knees , was loudest i have ever heard . great anger
ratings for nfl football are way down except before game starts , when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!
big election tomorrow in the great state of alabama . vote for senator luther strange , tough on crime & border - will never let you down!
a few of the many clips of john mccain talking about repealing & replacing ocare . my oh my has he changed-complete turn from years of talk !
owed to wall street and the banks which , sadly , must be dealt with . food , water and medical are top priorities - and doing well . #fema
its old electrical grid , which was in terrible shape , was devastated . much of the island was destroyed , with billions of dollars.
texas & florida are doing great but puerto rico , which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt , is in deep trouble.
tremendous backlash against the nfl and its players for disrespect of our country . #standforouranthem🇺🇸
general john kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on nfl players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our flag or great country!
@cnn is #fakenews . just reported cos john kelly was opposed to my stance on nfl players disrespecting flag , anthem , country . total lie!
#standforouranthem
the white house never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night . important meetings taking place today . big tax cuts & reform.
the issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race . it is about respect for our country , flag and national anthem . nfl must respect this!
many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday which was a small percentage of total . these are fans who demand respect for our flag!
so proud of nascar and its supporters and fans . they wont put up with disrespecting our country or our flag - they said it loud and clear!
making america safe is my number one priority . we will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet .
sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their national anthem or their country . nfl should change policy!
alaska , arizona , maine and kentucky are big winners in the healthcare proposal . 7 years of repeal & replace and some senators not there.
courageous patriots have fought and died for our great american flag - we must honor and respect it ! make america great again!
please to inform that the champion pittsburgh penguins of the nhl will be joining me at the white house for ceremony . great team!
great solidarity for our national anthem and for our country . standing with locked arms is good , kneeling is not acceptable . bad ratings!
nfl attendance and ratings are way down . boring games yes , but many stay away because they love our country . league should back u . s.
if nfl fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our flag & country , you will see change take place fast . fire or suspend!
just heard foreign minister of north korea speak at u . n. if he echoes thoughts of little rocket man , they wont be around much longer!
roger goodell of nfl just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country . tell them to stand!
democrats are laughingly saying that mccain had a moment of courage . tell that to the people of arizona who were deceived . 116% increase!
iran just test-fired a ballistic missile capable of reaching israel . they are also working with north korea . not much of an agreement we have!
very proud of our incredible first lady @flotus . she is a truly great representative for our country !
our great american flag or country and should stand for the national anthem . if not , youre fired . find something else to do!
if a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the nfl , or other leagues , he or she should not be allowed to disrespect.
going to the white house is considered a great honor for a championship team . stephen curry is hesitating , therefore invitation is withdrawn!
it was great being with luther strange last night in alabama . what great people , what a crowd ! vote luther on tuesday.
alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under obamacare , worst in the country . deductibles high , people angry ! lisa m comes through.
i know rand paul and i think he may find a way to get there for the good of the party!
large block grants to states is a good thing to do . better control & management . great for arizona . mccain let his best friend l . g. down!
arizona had a 116% increase in obamacare premiums last year , with deductibles very high . chuck schumer sold john mccain a bill of goods . sad
john mccain never had any intention of voting for this bill , which his governor loves . he campaigned on repeal & replace . let arizona down!
heading to alabama now , big crowd!
thank you to doug parker and american airlines for all of the help you have given to the u . s. with hurricane flights . fantastic job!
#usaatunga🇺🇸#unga
will be in alabama tonight . luther strange has gained mightily since my endorsement , but will be very close . he loves alabama , and so do i!
the greatest influence over our election was the fake news media screaming for crooked hillary clinton . next , she was a bad candidate!
the russia hoax continues , now its ads on facebook . what about the totally biased and dishonest media coverage in favor of crooked hillary?
thank you !
kim jong un of north korea , who is obviously a madman who doesnt mind starving or killing his people , will be tested like never before!

chain migration cannot be allowed to be part of any legislation on immigration!
espn is paying a really big price for its politics and bad programming . people are dumping it in record numbers . apologize for untruth!
we have made more progress in the last nine months against isis than the obama administration has made in 8 years . must be proactive & nasty!
the travel ban into the united states should be far larger , tougher and more specific-but stupidly , that would not be politically correct!
loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner . the internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off & use better!
another attack in london by a loser terrorist . these are sick and demented people who were in the sights of scotland yard . must be proactive!
with the ridiculous filibuster rule in the senate , republicans need 60 votes to pass legislation , rather than 51. cant get votes , end now!

am leaving now for florida to see our great first responders and to thank the u . s. coast guard , fema etc . a real disaster , much work to do!
they have been in our country for many years through no fault of their own - brought in by parents at young age . plus big border security
does anybody really want to throw out good , educated and accomplished young people who have jobs , some serving in the military ? really ! .
the wall , which is already under construction in the form of new renovation of old and existing fences and walls , will continue to be built.
no deal was made last night on daca . massive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent . would be subject to vote.
the deplorables came back to haunt hillary . they expressed their feelings loud and clear . she spent big money but , in the end , had no game!
crooked hillary clinton blames everybody and every thing but herself for her election loss . she lost the debates and lost her direction!
china has a business tax rate of 15% . we should do everything possible to match them in order to win with our economy . jobs and wages!

churches in texas should be entitled to reimbursement from fema relief funds for helping victims of hurricane harvey just like others.
a message to my fellow americans🇺🇸#irmahurricane2017 🎥 🎥
republicans must start the tax reform/tax cut legislation asap . dont wait until the end of september . needed now more than ever . hurry!
never allow the republicans to pass even great legislation . 8 dems control - will rarely get 60 vs . 51 votes . it is a repub death wish!
republicans , sorry , but ive been hearing about repeal & replace for 7 years , didnt happen ! even worse , the senate filibuster rule will.
our incredible u . s. coast guard saved more than 15,000 lives last week with harvey . irma could be even tougher . we love our coast guard!
hurricane irma is of epic proportion , perhaps bigger than we have ever seen . be safe and get out of its way , if possible . federal g is ready!
we will confront any challenge , no matter how strong the winds or high the water . i’m proud to stand with presidents for #oneamericaappeal.
i encourage everyone in the path of #hurricaneirma to heed the advice and orders of local & state officials !
during my trip to saudi arabia , i spoke to the leaders of more than 50 arab & muslim nations about the need to confront our shared enemies .

hurricane irma is raging but we have great teams of talented and brave people already in place and ready to help . be careful , be safe ! #fema
we want our companies to hire & grow in america , to raise wages for american workers , & to help rebuild our american cities & towns ! #usa🇺🇸

the united states is considering , in addition to other options , stopping all trade with any country doing business with north korea.
i will be meeting general kelly , general mattis and other military leaders at the white house to discuss north korea . thank you.
south korea is finding , as i have told them , that their talk of appeasement with north korea will not work , they only understand one thing!
north korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to china , which is trying to help but with little success.
north korea has conducted a major nuclear test . their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the united states.
so much spirit in la ! thank you to all of our hereos who saved many lives . an honor to spend time w/ @nationalguard , #leos & the #cajunnavy !

after many years of failure , countries are coming together to finally address the dangers posed by north korea . we must be tough & decisive!
i will be holding a major briefing on the opioid crisis , a major problem for our country , today at 3:00  in bedminster , n . j.
i think senator blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in vietnam , where he lied about his service , so he can at least say he was there
how much longer will the failing nytimes , with its big losses and massive unfunded liability and non-existent sources , remain in business?
the fake news media will not talk about the importance of the united nations security councils 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on n . korea!
on #purpleheartday💜i thank all the brave men and women who have sacrificed in battle for this great nation ! #usa🇺🇸
conquests , how brave he was , and it was all a lie . he cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child . now he judges collusion?
never in u . s.history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like senator richard blumenthal . he told stories about his vietnam battles and.
interesting to watch senator richard blumenthal of connecticut talking about hoax russian collusion when he was a phony vietnam con artist!
working hard from new jersey while white house goes through long planned renovation . going to new york next week for more meetings.
hard to believe that with 24/7 #fake news on cnn , abc , nbc , cbs , nytimes & wapo , the trump base is getting stronger!
 supreme court pick , economic enthusiasm , deregulation & so much more have driven the trump base even closer together . will never change!
and west virginia . the fact is the fake news russian collusion story , record stock market , border security , military strength , jobs.
the trump base is far bigger & stronger than ever before despite some phony fake news polling . look at rallies in penn , iowa , ohio.
the failing @nytimes , which has made every wrong prediction about me including my big election win apologized , is totally inept!
just completed call with president moon of south korea . very happy and impressed with 15-0 united nations vote on north korea sanctions.
the fake news refuses to report the success of the first 6 months: s . c. , surging economy & jobs , border & military security , isis & ms-13 etc.
make america great again !
united nations resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever on north korea . over one billion dollars in cost to n . k.
thank you nicole !
after many years of leaks going on in washington , it is great to see the a . g. taking action ! for national security , the tougher the better!
the united nations security council just voted 15-0 to sanction north korea . china and russia voted with us . very big financial impact!
working in bedminster , n . j. , as long planned construction is being done at the white house . this is not a vacation - meetings and calls!
under trump , gains against #isis have dramatically accelerated
prosperity is coming back to our shores because we are putting america workers and families first . #americafirst🇺🇸

i love the white house , one of the most beautiful buildings homes i have ever seen . but fake news said i called it a dump - totally untrue
i campaigned on creating a merit-based immigration system that protects u . s. workers & taxpayers . watch: #raiseact
why the rust belt just gave donald trump a heros welcome

stock market could hit all-time high again 22,000 today . was 18,000 only 6 months ago on election day . mainstream media seldom mentions!
a great day at the white house!
highest stock market ever , best economic numbers in years , unemployment lowest in 17 years , wages raising , border secure , s . c.: no wh chaos!
if obamacare is hurting people , & it is , why shouldnt it hurt the insurance companies & why should congress not be paying what public pays?
dont give up republican senators , the world is watching: repeal & replace . and go to 51 votes nuke option , get cross state lines & more.
they do nothing for us with north korea , just talk . we will no longer allow this to continue . china could easily solve this problem!
i am very disappointed in china . our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade , yet.
i love reading about all of the geniuses who were so instrumental in my election success . problem is , most dont exist . #fake news ! maga
unless the republican senators are total quitters , repeal & replace is not dead ! demand another vote before voting on any other bill!
u . s. stock market up almost 20% since election!
if a new healthcare bill is not approved quickly , bailouts for insurance companies and bailouts for members of congress will end very soon!
after seven years of talking repeal & replace , the people of our great country are still being forced to live with imploding obamacare!
if the senate democrats ever got the chance , they would switch to a 51 majority vote in first minute . they are laughing at rs . make change!
8 dems totally control the u . s. senate . many great republican bills will never pass , like kates law and complete healthcare . get smart!
republicans in the senate will never win if they dont go to a 51 vote majority now . they look like fools and are just wasting time.
the very outdated filibuster rule must go . budget reconciliation is killing rs in senate . mitch m , go to 51 votes now and win . its time!
republican senate must get rid of 60 vote now ! it is killing the r party , allows 8 dems to control country . 200 bills sit in senate . a joke!
in other words , russia was against trump in the 2016 election - and why not , i want strong military & low oil prices . witch hunt !
we will defend our country , protect our communities and put the safety of the american people first ! replay:
i would like to thank reince priebus for his service and dedication to his country . we accomplished a lot together and i am proud of him!

we will always enforce our laws , protect our borders , and support our police ! #lesm harrisburg , pennsylvania #flashbackfriday #ms13
even though parts of healthcare could pass at 51, some really good things need 60. so many great future bills & budgets need 60 votes.
if republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the senate , they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority , not senseless 60.
3 republicans and 48 democrats let the american people down . as i said from the beginning , let obamacare implode , then deal . watch!
go republican senators , go ! get there after waiting for 7 years . give america great healthcare!
it was my great honor to present our nations highest award for a public safety officer - the medal of valor to five american heroes !

about then candidate trump . catherine herridge @foxnews . so why doesnt fake news report this ? witch hunt ! purposely phony reporting.
one of the things that has been lost in the politics of this situation is that the russians collected and spread negative information.
come on republican senators , you can do it on healthcare . after 7 years , this is your chance to shine ! dont let the american people down!
wow , the failing @nytimes said about @foxandfriends . the most powerful t . v. show in america.

so great that john mccain is coming back to vote . brave - american hero ! thank you john.
obamacare is torturing the american people . the democrats have fooled the people long enough . repeal or repeal & replace ! i have pen in hand.
big day for healthcare . after 7 years of talking , we will soon see whether or not republicans are willing to step up to the plate!
problem is that the acting head of the fbi & the person in charge of the hillary investigation , andrew mccabe , got $700,000 from h for wife!
attorney general jeff sessions has taken a very weak position on hillary clinton crimes where are e-mails & dnc server & intel leakers!
ukrainian efforts to sabotage trump campaign - quietly working to boost clinton . so where is the investigation a . g. @seanhannity
is fake news washington post being used as a lobbyist weapon against congress to keep politicians from looking into amazon no-tax monopoly?
so many stories about me in the @washingtonpost are fake news . they are as bad as ratings challenged @cnn . lobbyist for amazon and taxes?
the amazon washington post fabricated the facts on my ending massive , dangerous , and wasteful payments to syrian rebels fighting assad.

arriving at joint base andrews with @secretaryperry , @secretaryzinke , and @secpricemd .
republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on repeal & replace after years of talking & campaigning on it.
sleazy adam schiff , the totally biased congressman looking into russia , spends all of his time on television pushing the dem loss excuse!
so why arent the committees and investigators , and of course our beleaguered a . g. , looking into crooked hillarys crimes & russia relations?
after 1 year of investigation with zero evidence being found , chuck schumer just stated that democrats should blame ourselves , not russia.
drain the swamp should be changed to drain the sewer - its actually much worse than anyone ever thought , and it begins with the fake news!
thank you to @loudobbs for giving the first six months of the trump administration an a+ . s . c. , reg cutting , stock m , jobs , border etc . = true!
if republicans dont repeal and replace the disastrous obamacare , the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand!
its hard to read the failing new york times or the amazon washington post because every story/opinion , even if should be positive , is bad!
its very sad that republicans , even some that were carried over the line on my back , do very little to protect their president.
as the phony russian witch hunt continues , two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold , democrats and russians!

obamacare is dead and the democrats are obstructionists , no ideas or votes , only obstruction . it is solely up to the 52 republican senators!
the republican senators must step up to the plate and , after 7 years , vote to repeal and replace . next , tax reform and infrastructure . win!
in all fairness to anthony scaramucci , he wanted to endorse me 1st , before the republican primaries started , but didnt think i was running!
my son donald openly gave his e-mails to the media & authorities whereas crooked hillary clinton deleted & acid washed her 33,000 e-mails!
what about all of the clinton ties to russia , including podesta company , uranium deal , russian reset , big dollar speeches etc.
so many people are asking why isnt the a . g. or special council looking at the many hillary clinton or comey crimes . 33,000 e-mails deleted?
while all agree the u . s . president has the complete power to pardon , why think of that when only crime so far is leaks against us . fake news
this morning i will be going to the commissioning ceremony for the largest aircraft carrier in the world , the gerald r . ford . norfolk , va.

melania and i send our thoughts and prayers to senator mccain , cindy , and their entire family . get well soon .
the republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is , & it will get even better at lunchtime . the dems scream death as ocare dies!
i will be having lunch at the white house today with republican senators concerning healthcare . they must keep their promise to america!
the fake news is becoming more and more dishonest ! even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in germany is made to look sinister!
fake news story of secret dinner with putin is sick . all g 20 leaders , and spouses , were invited by the chancellor of germany . press knew!
the senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes . even parts of full repeal need 60. 8 dems control senate . crazy!
with only a very small majority , the republicans in the house & senate need more victories next year since dems totally obstruct , no votes!
as i have always said , let obamacare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan . stay tuned!
we were let down by all of the democrats and a few republicans . most republicans were loyal , terrific & worked really hard . we will return!
republicans should just repeal failing obamacare now & work on a new healthcare plan that will start from a clean slate . dems will join in!
most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent . thats politics!
heading back to washington , DC much will be accomplished this week on trade , the military and security!

after all of these years of suffering thru obamacare , republican senators must come through as they have promised!

@washtimes states democrats have willfully used moscow disinformation to influence the presidential election against donald trump.
isis is on the run & will soon be wiped out of syria & iraq , illegal border crossings are way down 75% & ms 13 gangs are being removed.
there are lots of really good lawyers in the country , he could have picked somebody else ! and i wish i did!
chief law enforcement officer , and they told me later , ‘oh by the way i’m not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office , i would be frustrated too . and that’s how i read that - senator sessions , why didn’t you tell me before i picked you.
rep . trey gowdy , i don’t think so , i think what the president is doing is expressing frustration that attorney general sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job , not afterward . if i were the president and i picked someone to be the country’s.
the fake mainstream media has , from the time i announced i was running for president , run the most highly sophisticated & dishonest disinformation campaign in the history of politics . no matter how well we do , they find fault . but the forgotten men & women won , i’m president!
sorry , i’ve got to start focusing my energy on north korea nuclear , bad trade deals , va choice , the economy , rebuilding the military , and so much more , and not on the rigged russia witch hunt that should be investigating clinton/russia/fbi/justice/obama/comey/lynch etc.
why aren’t the 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats investigating the totally crooked campaign of totally crooked hillary clinton . it’s a rigged witch hunt , that’s why ! ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration!
the 13 angry democrats plus people who worked 8 years for obama working on the rigged russia witch hunt , will be meddling with the mid-term elections , especially now that republicans stay tough ! are taking the lead in polls . there was no collusion , except by the democrats!
this investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about . it wasn’t just a wiretap against a campaign aide . it was secretly gathering information on the trump campaign . people call that spying . this is unprecedented and scandalous . mollie hemingway
we have put a great team together for our talks with north korea . meetings are currently taking place concerning summit , and more . kim young chol , the vice chairman of north korea , heading now to new york . solid response to my letter , thank you!
democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from obama’s term showing children from the border in steel cages . they thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad , but backfires . dems must agree to wall and new border protection for good of country . bipartisan bill!
california has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime , high tax , problems - along with so many others . on june 5th . , vote for gop gubernatorial candidate john cox , a really good and highly competent man . he’ll make california great again!
a democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to repeal the gop tax cuts no chance . this is too good to be true for republicans . remember , the nancy pelosi dems are also weak on crime , the border and want to be gentle and kind to ms-13 gang members . not good!
our fallen heroes have not only written our history they have shaped our destiny . they saved the lives of the men and women with whom they served . they cared for their families more than anything in the world , they loved their families . they inspired their communities .
the heroes who rest in these hallowed fields , in cemeteries , battlefields , and burial grounds near and far are drawn the full tapestry of american life . they came from every generation from towering cities and wind swept prairies , from privilege and from poverty .
thank you for joining us on this solemn day of remembrance . we are gathered here on the sacred soil of @arlingtonnatl cemetery to honor the lives and deeds of americas greatest heroes , the men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom . #memorialday
we now find out that the obama administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate , or his campaign , under investigation . that raises legitimate questions . i just find this really odd . this goes to the heart of our electoral system . jonathan turley on @foxnews

#memorialday🇺🇸
why didn’t president obama do something about the so-called russian meddling when he was told about it by the fbi before the election ? because he thought crooked hillary was going to win , and he didn’t want to upset the apple cart ! he was in charge , not me , and did nothing.
our united states team has arrived in north korea to make arrangements for the summit between kim jong un and myself . i truly believe north korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial nation one day . kim jong un agrees with me on this . it will happen!
why didn’t the 13 angry democrats investigate the campaign of crooked hillary clinton , many crimes , much collusion with russia ? why didn’t the fbi take the server from the dnc ? rigged investigation!
fantastic to have 400,000 great men & women of rolling thunder in DC showing their patriotism . they love our country , they love our flag , they stand for our national anthem ! thanks to executive director artie muller.
who’s going to give back the young and beautiful lives and others that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony russia collusion witch hunt ? they journeyed down to washington , DC , with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation . they went back home in tatters!
welcome home josh !
when will the 13 angry democrats & those who worked for president o , reveal their disqualifying conflicts of interest ? it’s been a long time now ! will they be indelibly written into the report along with the fact that the only collusion is with the dems , justice , fbi & russia?
this whole russia probe is rigged . just an excuse as to why the dems and crooked hillary lost the election and states that haven’t been lost in decades . 13 angry democrats , and all dems if you include the people who worked for obama for 8 years . #spygate & conflicts of interest!
with spies , or informants as the democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister but it’s not , all over my campaign , even from a very early date , why didn’t the crooked highest levels of the fbi or justice contact me to tell me of the phony russia problem?
the failing @nytimes quotes a senior white house official , who doesn’t exist , as saying even if the meeting were reinstated , holding it on june 12 would be impossible , given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed . wrong again ! use real people , not phony sources.
unlike what the failing and corrupt new york times would like people to believe , there is zero disagreement within the trump administration as to how to deal with north korea . and if there was , it wouldn’t matter . the @nytimes has called me wrong right from the beginning!
thanks to very brave teacher & hero jason seaman of noblesville , indiana , for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives . his quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world!
looking forward to seeing joshua holt this evening in the white house . the great people of utah are celebrating!
put pressure on the democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the border into the u . s. catch and release , lottery and chain must also go with it and we must continue building the wall ! democrats are protecting ms-13 thugs.
good news about the release of the american hostage from venezuela . should be landing in DC this evening and be in the white house , with his family , at about 7:00 p.m. the great people of utah will be very happy!
we are having very productive talks with north korea about reinstating the summit which , if it does happen , will likely remain in singapore on the same date , june 12th . , and , if necessary , will be extended beyond that date.
but complain and obstruct . they made only bad deals iran and their so-called trade deals are the laughing stock of the world!
senator schumer and obama administration let phone company zte flourish with no security checks . i closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees , change of management and board , must purchase u . s. parts and pay a $1.3 billion fine . dems do nothing.
funny to watch the democrats criticize trade deals being negotiated by me when they don’t even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the obama administration did nothing on trade except let other countries rip off the united states . lost almost $800 billion/year under o
chicago police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won’t let them do their job . the killings are at a record pace and tough police work , which chicago will not allow , would bring things back to order fast . the killings must stop!
to the @navalacademy class of 2018, i say: we know you are up to the task . we know you will make us proud . we know that glory will be yours . because you are winners , you are warriors , you are fighters , you are champions , and you will lead us to victory ! god bless the u . s.a . !
on behalf of the american people , congratulations ! we love you !
today , it was my great honor to deliver the 2018 commencement address at the united states @navalacademy in annapolis , maryland . congratulations ! good luck . godspeed . and anchors aweigh !
very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from north korea . we will soon see where it will lead , hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace . only time and talent will tell!
democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with north korea . just like they are coming to the defense of ms 13 thugs , saying that they are individuals & must be nurtured , or asking to end your big tax cuts & raise your taxes instead . dems have lost touch!
everyone knows there was a spy , and in fact the people who were involved in the spying are admitting that there was a spy . widespread spying involving multiple people . mollie hemingway , the federalist senior editor but the corrupt mainstream media hates this monster story!
can anyone even imagine having spies placed in a competing campaign , by the people and party in absolute power , for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain ? and to think that the party in question , even with the expenditure of far more money , lost!
the democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an informant placed in an opposing party’s campaign is different than having a spy , as illegal as that may be . but what about an informant who is paid a fortune and who sets up way earlier than the russian hoax?
i will be making the commencment address today at the united states naval academy in annapolis , maryland . look forward to being with some of the greatest people on earth!
today , it was my great honor to present the #medalofhonor to @usnavy seal master chief special warfare operator britt slabinski in the east room of the @whitehouse . full ceremony:
today , it was my honor to sign #s2155, the economic growth , regulatory relief , and consumer protection act . read more:
i have decided to terminate the planned summit in singapore on june 12th . while many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially , i believe that this is a tremendous setback for north korea and indeed a setback for the world .
it was my great honor to host a roundtable re: ms-13 yesterday in bethpage , new york . democrats must abandon their resistance to border security so that we can support law enforcement and save innocent lives !
sadly , i was forced to cancel the summit meeting in singapore with kim jong un .
sadly , i was forced to cancel the summit meeting in singapore with kim jung un .
not surprisingly , the great men & women of the fbi are starting to speak out against comey , mccabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the fbi . comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the fbi ! #spygate
clapper has now admitted that there was spying in my campaign . large dollars were paid to the spy , far beyond normal . starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in u . s. history . spygate - a terrible thing!
will be interviewed on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning at 6:00 a.m. enjoy!
great to be in new york for the day . heading back to the @whitehouse now , lots of work to be done !
thank you to all of the incredible law enforcement officers and firefighters in bethpage , new york . keep up the great work !
crippling loopholes in our laws have enabled ms-13 gang members and other criminals to infiltrate our communities - and democrats in congress refuse to close these loopholes , including the disgraceful practice known as catch-and-release . democrats must abandon their resistance .
today on long island , we were all moved to be joined by families who have suffered unthinkable heartbreak at the hands of ms-13. i was truly honored to be joined again by the courageous families who were my guests at the state of the union .
thank you @sbalist ! #sbagala
witch hunt!
there will be big news coming soon for our great american autoworkers . after many decades of losing your jobs to other countries , you have waited long enough!
big legislation will be signed by me shortly . after many years , right to try and big changes to dodd frank.
our trade deal with china is moving along nicely , but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion.
trump should be happy that the fbi was spying on his campaign no , james clapper , i am not happy . spying on a campaign would be illegal , and a scandal to boot!
everybody is with tomi lahren , a truly outstanding and respected young woman ! @foxandfriends
spygate could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!
it’s clear that they had eyes and ears all over the trump campaign judge andrew napolitano
look how things have turned around on the criminal deep state . they go after phony collusion with russia , a made up scam , and end up getting caught in a major spy scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before ! what goes around , comes around!
@foxandfriends new bombshell in the obama spying scandal . did other agencies spy on trump campaign ? even clapper , worlds dumbest former intelligence head , who has the problem of lying a lot , used the word spy when describing the illegal activities!
follow the money ! the spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported collusion with russia , because there was no collusion . he was only there to spy for political reasons and to help crooked hillary win - just like they did to bernie sanders , who got duped!
if the person placed very early into my campaign wasn’t a spy put there by the previous administration for political purposes , how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal.
for the first time since roe v . wade , america has a pro-life president , a pro-life vice president , a pro-life house of representatives and 25 pro-life republican state capitals !
it was my honor to welcome @nascar cup series champion @martintruex_jr and his team to the @whitehouse yesterday !
today , it was my great honor to welcome president moon jae-in of the republic of korea to the @whitehouse ! 🇺🇸🇰🇷
@asahutchinson , the great governor of arkansas , is in a primary tomorrow . he has done an incredible job with a focus on lower taxes , border security , and crime prevention . asa loves our military and our veterans . i fully endorse asa for governor!
under our potential deal with china , they will purchase from our great american farmers practically as much as our farmers can produce.
the wall street journal asks , where in the world was barack obama ? a very good question!
they then used to start an investigation about trump . it is that simple . this guy is the genesis of this whole debacle . this was a political hit job , this was not an intelligence investigation . brennan has disgraced himself , he’s worried about staying out of jail . dan bongino
top of the fbi . brennan started this entire debacle about president trump . we now know that brennan had detailed knowledge of the phony dossier . he knows about the dossier , he denies knowledge of the dossier , he briefs the gang of 8 on the hill about the dossier , which.
john brennan is panicking . he has disgraced himself , he has disgraced the country , he has disgraced the entire intelligence community . he is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of american’s faith in the intelligence community and in some people at the.
china must continue to be strong & tight on the border of north korea until a deal is made . the word is that recently the border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in . i want this to happen , and north korea to be very successful , but only after signing!
on china , barriers and tariffs to come down for first time.
china has agreed to buy massive amounts of additional farm/agricultural products - would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years!
i ask senator chuck schumer , why didn’t president obama & the democrats do something about trade with china , including theft of intellectual property etc . ? they did nothing ! with that being said , chuck & i have long agreed on this issue ! fair trade , plus , with china will happen!
i hereby demand , and will do so officially tomorrow , that the department of justice look into whether or not the fbi/doj infiltrated or surveilled the trump campaign for political purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the obama administration!
the witch hunt finds no collusion with russia - so now they’re looking at the rest of the world . oh’ great!
and why hasn’t the podesta brother been charged and arrested , like others , after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm ? is it because he is a very well connected democrat working in the swamp of washington , DC?
what ever happened to the server , at the center of so much corruption , that the democratic national committee refused to hand over to the hard charging except in the case of democrats fbi ? they broke into homes & offices early in the morning , but were afraid to take the server?
now that the witch hunt has given up on russia and is looking at the rest of the world , they should easily be able to take it into the mid-term elections where they can put some hurt on the republican party . don’t worry about dems fisa abuse , missing emails or fraudulent dossier!
in the hillary clinton campaign where she deleted 33,000 emails , got $145,000,000 while secretary of state , paid mccabes wife $700,000 and got off the fbi hook along with terry m and so much more . republicans and real americans should start getting tough on this scam.
at what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 witch hunt , composed of 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats and two people who have worked for obama for 8 years , stop ! they have found no collussion with russia , no obstruction , but they aren’t looking at the corruption.
things are really getting ridiculous . the failing and crooked but not as crooked as hillary clinton @nytimes has done a long & boring story indicating that the world’s most expensive witch hunt has found nothing on russia & me so now they are looking at the rest of the world!
if the fbi or doj was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign , that is a really big deal . only the release or review of documents that the house intelligence committee also , senate judiciary is asking for can give the conclusive answers . drain the swamp!
great to have our incredible first lady back home in the white house . melania is feeling and doing really well . thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!
great to have our incredible first lady back home in the white house . melanie is feeling and doing really well . thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!
happy #armedforcesday to our great military men and women for their selfless service to our nation !
america is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance , including more than 250 years worth of beautiful clean coal . we have ended the war on coal , and will continue to work to promote american energy dominance!
california finally deserves a great governor , one who understands borders , crime and lowering taxes . john cox is the man - he’ll be the best governor you’ve ever had . i fully endorse john cox for governor and look forward to working with him to make california great again!
just met with un secretary-general antónio guterres who is working hard to make the united nations great again . when the un does more to solve conflicts around the world , it means the u . s. has less to do and we save money . @nikkihaley is doing a fantastic job !
america is a nation that believes in the power of redemption . america is a nation that believes in second chances - and america is a nation that believes that the best is always yet to come ! #prisonreform
we grieve for the terrible loss of life , and send our support and love to everyone affected by this horrible attack in texas . to the students , families , teachers and personnel at santa fe high school – we are with you in this tragic hour , and we will be with you forever .
school shooting in texas . early reports not looking good . god bless all!
reports are there was indeed at least one fbi representative implanted , for political purposes , into my campaign for president . it took place very early on , and long before the phony russia hoax became a hot fake news story . if true - all time biggest political scandal!
why isn’t disgraced fbi official andrew mccabe being investigated for the $700,000 crooked hillary democrats in virginia , led by clinton best friend terry m under fbi investigation that they killed gave to mccabe’s wife in her run for office ? then dropped case on clinton!
fake news media had me calling immigrants , or illegal immigrants , animals . wrong ! they were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories . i referred to ms 13 gang members as animals , a big difference - and so true . fake news got it purposely wrong , as usual!
apparently the doj put a spy in the trump campaign . this has never been done before and by any means necessary , they are out to frame donald trump for crimes he didn’t commit . david asman @loudobbs @greggjarrett really bad stuff!
it was my great honor to visit with our heroes last night at walter reed medical center . there is nobody like them !
tomorrow , the house will vote on a strong farm bill , which includes work requirements . we must support our nation’s great farmers!
great talk with my friend president mauricio macri of argentina this week . he is doing such a good job for argentina . i support his vision for transforming his country’s economy and unleashing its potential!
talking trade with the vice premier of the people’s republic of china , liu he .
congratulations to our new cia director , gina haspel !
congrats to the house for passing the va mission act yesterday . without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care . putting politics over our veterans care is unacceptable – senate must vote yes on this bill by memorial day!
despite the disgusting , illegal and unwarranted witch hunt , we have had the most successful first 17 month administration in u . s. history - by far ! sorry to the fake news media and haters , but that’s the way it is!
wow , word seems to be coming out that the obama fbi spied on the trump campaign with an embedded informant . andrew mccarthy says , there’s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign . if so , this is bigger than watergate!
wow , word seems to be coming out that the obama fbi spied on the trump campaign with an imbedded informant . andrew mccarthy says , there’s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign . if so , this is bigger than watergate!
congratulations america , we are now into the second year of the greatest witch hunt in american history . and there is still no collusion and no obstruction . the only collusion was that done by democrats who were unable to win an election despite the spending of far more money!
gina haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the cia . she is exceptionally qualified and the senate should confirm her immediately . we need her to keep our great country safe ! #confirmgina
and voted against the massive tax cut bill . he’s also weak on borders and crime . sadly , our great military and vets mean nothing to bobby jr . lou barletta will win ! #maga
lou barletta will be a great senator for pennsylvania but his opponent , bob casey , has been a do-nothing senator who only shows up at election time . he votes along the nancy pelosi , elizabeth warren lines , loves sanctuary cities , bad and expensive healthcare.
today , it was my great honor to welcome president mirziyoyev of uzbekistan to the @whitehouse !
house votes today on choice/mission act . who will stand with our great vets , caregivers , and veterans service organizations ? must get choice passed by memorial day!
we have not seen china’s demands yet , which should be few in that previous u . s. administrations have done so poorly in negotiating . china has seen our demands . there has been no folding as the media would love people to believe , the meetings.
haven’t even started yet ! the u . s. has very little to give , because it has given so much over the years . china has much to give!
the washington post and cnn have typically written false stories about our trade negotiations with china . nothing has happened with zte except as it pertains to the larger trade deal . our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with china.
congratulations to deb fischer . the people of nebraska have seen what a great job she is doing - and it showed up at the ballot box ! #maga
congratulations to lou barletta of pennsylvania . he will be a great senator and will represent his people well - like they haven’t been represented in many years . lou is a friend of mine and a special guy , he will very much help make america great again!
thank you to the washington examiner and @cortessteve on the great article - on winning !
#peaceofficersmemorialday
today is one of the most important and solemn occasions of the year – the day we pay tribute to the law enforcement heroes who gave their lives in the line of duty . they made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could live in safety and peace . we stand with our police heroes 100% !
nebraska - make sure you get out to the polls and vote for deb fischer today !
can you believe that with all of the made up , unsourced stories i get from the fake news media , together with the $10,000,000 russian witch hunt there is no collusion , i now have my best poll numbers in a year . much of the media may be corrupt , but the people truly get it!
trade negotiations are continuing with china . they have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the u . s. , for many years . stay tuned!
our great first lady is doing really well . will be leaving hospital in 2 or 3 days . thank you for so much love and support!
heading over to walter reed medical center to see our great first lady , melania . successful procedure , she is in good spirits . thank you to all of the well-wishers!
the so-called leaks coming out of the white house are a massive over exaggeration put out by the fake news media in order to make us look as bad as possible . with that being said , leakers are traitors and cowards , and we will find out who they are!
zte , the large chinese phone company , buys a big percentage of individual parts from u . s. companies . this is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with china and my personal relationship with president xi.
#usembassyjerusalem
big day for israel . congratulations!
u . s. embassy opening in jerusalem will be covered live on @foxnews & @foxbusiness . lead up to 9:00 a.m. eastern event has already begun . a great day for israel!
so sad to see the terror attack in paris . at some point countries will have to open their eyes & see what is really going on . this kind of sickness & hatred is not compatible with a loving , peaceful , & successful country ! changes to our thought process on terror must be made.
remember how badly iran was behaving with the iran deal in place . they were trying to take over the middle east by whatever means necessary . now , that will not happen!
china and the united states are working well together on trade , but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of china , for so many years , that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries . but be cool , it will all work out!
president xi of china , and i , are working together to give massive chinese phone company , zte , a way to get back into business , fast . too many jobs in china lost . commerce department has been instructed to get it done!
happy mother’s day ! !!
the senate should get funding done before the august break , or not go home . wall and border security should be included . also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations , worst in history . democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct , all they know how to do . stay!
iran’s military budget is up more than 40% since the obama negotiated nuclear deal was reached . just another indicator that it was all a big lie . but not anymore!
north korea has announced that they will dismantle nuclear test site this month , ahead of the big summit meeting on june 12th . thank you , a very smart and gracious gesture!
why doesn’t the fake news media state that the trump administration’s anti-trust division has been , and is , opposed to the at&t purchase of time warner in a currently ongoing trial . such a disgrace in reporting!
big week next week when the american embassy in israel will be moved to jerusalem . congratulations to all!
the american people deserve a healthcare system that takes care of them – not one that takes advantage of them . we will work every day to ensure all americans have access to the quality , affordable medication they need and deserve . we will not rest until the job is done !
today , my administration is launching the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the american people . we will have tougher negotiation , more competition , and much lower prices at the pharmacy counter !
thank you indiana ! #maga🇺🇸
the highly anticipated meeting between kim jong un and myself will take place in singapore on june 12th . we will both try to make it a very special moment for world peace!
five most wanted leaders of isis just captured!
senator cryin’ chuck schumer fought hard against the bad iran deal , even going at it with president obama , & then voted against it ! now he says i should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn’t really believe that ! same with comey . thought he was terrible until i fired him!
on behalf of the american people , welcome home !
gina haspel did a spectacular job today . there is nobody even close to run the cia!
looking forward to greeting the hostages no longer at 2:00 a.m.
the failing new york times criticized secretary of state pompeo for being awol missing , when in fact he was flying to north korea . fake news , so bad!
secretary pompeo and his guests will be landing at andrews air force base at 2:00 a.m. in the morning . i will be there to greet them . very exciting!
i am pleased to inform you that secretary of state mike pompeo is in the air and on his way back from north korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting . they seem to be in good health . also , good meeting with kim jong un . date & place set.
congratulations to mike dewine on his big win in the great state of ohio . he will be a great governor with a heavy focus on healthcare and jobs . his socialist opponent in november should not do well , a big failure in last job!
candace owens of turning point usa is having a big impact on politics in our country . she represents an ever expanding group of very smart thinkers , and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going on . so good for our country!
the fake news is working overtime . just reported that , despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy & all things else , 91% of the network news about me is negative fake . why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt ? take away credentials?
the republican party had a great night . tremendous voter energy and excitement , and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in november . the economy is sooo strong , and with nancy pelosi wanting to end the big tax cuts and raise taxes , why wouldn’t we win?
the iran deal is defective at its core . if we do nothing , we know what will happen . in just a short time , the world’s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world’s most dangerous weapons .
statement on the iran nuclear deal:
john kerry can’t get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it ! stay away from negotiations john , you are hurting your country!
i will be speaking to my friend , president xi of china , this morning at 8:30. the primary topics will be trade , where good things will happen , and north korea , where relationships and trust are building.
gina haspel , my highly respected nominee to lead the cia , is being praised for the fact that she has been , and alway will be , tough on terror ! this is a woman who has been a leader wherever she has gone . the cia wants her to lead them into america’s bright and glorious future!
i will be announcing my decision on the iran deal tomorrow from the white house at 2:00pm.
national prescription drug #takebackday numbers are in ! another record broken: nearly 1 million pounds of rx pills disposed ! let’s keep fighting this opioid epidemic , america!
the united states does not need john kerry’s possibly illegal shadow diplomacy on the very badly negotiated iran deal . he was the one that created this mess in the first place!
is this phony witch hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the mid-term elections , which is what the democrats always intended ? republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!
lisa page , who may hold the record for the most emails in the shortest period of time to her lover , peter s , and attorney baker , are out at the fbi as part of the probers getting caught ? why is peter s still there ? what a total mess . our country has to get back to business!
good luck to ric grenell , our new ambassador to germany . a great and talented guy , he will represent our country well!
the great revolt by salena zito and brad todd does much to tell the story of our great election victory . the forgotten men & women are forgotten no longer!
the 13 angry democrats in charge of the russian witch hunt are starting to find out that there is a court system in place that actually protects people from injustice . and just wait ‘till the courts get to see your unrevealed conflicts of interest!
the russia witch hunt is rapidly losing credibility . house intelligence committee found no collusion , coordination or anything else with russia . so now the probe says ok , what else is there ? how about obstruction for a made up , phony crime . there is no o , it’s called fighting back
my highly respected nominee for cia director , gina haspel , has come under fire because she was too tough on terrorists . think of that , in these very dangerous times , we have the most qualified person , a woman , who democrats want out because she is too tough on terror . win gina!
to the great people of west virginia we have , together , a really great chance to keep making a big difference . problem is , don blankenship , currently running for senate , can’t win the general election in your state . no way ! remember alabama . vote rep . jenkins or a . g. morrisey!
thank you cleveland , ohio !
our high level delegation is on the way back from china where they had long meetings with chinese leaders and business representatives . we will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results , but it is hard for china in that they have become very spoiled with u . s. trade wins!
just returned home to the beautiful white house , from dallas , where the arena was packed to the rafters with the great fans and supporters of the @nra . it was so wonderful to be there!
great book just out by very successful businessman @andypuzder . always known as somebody who knows how to win , capitalist comeback will be a big hit!
i want to thank all of our friends and patriots at the @nra . we will never fail , and we will always protect your second amendment ! god bless you , and god bless america !
we are going to demand congress secure the border in the upcoming cr . illegal immigration must end!
democrats and liberals in congress want to disarm law-abiding americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets . politicians who put criminal aliens before american citizens should be voted out of office!
all of us here today are united by the same timeless values . we believe that our liberty is a gift from our creator , and that no government can ever take it away . we believe in the rule of law - and we support the men and women of law enforcement . we have pride in our history .
just out: 3.9% unemployment . 4% is broken ! in the meantime , witch hunt!
going to dallas the great state of texas today . leaving soon!
nbc news is wrong again ! they cite sources which are constantly wrong . problem is , like so many others , the sources probably don’t exist , they are fabricated , fiction ! nbc , my former home with the apprentice , is now as bad as fake news cnn . sad!
andy mccarthy will be on @loudobbs tonight . 7:00 p.m. , @foxbusiness.
because jobs in the u . s. are doing so well , americans receiving unemployment aid is the lowest since 1973. great!
our southern border is under siege . congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws . must build a wall . mexico , which has a massive crime problem , is doing little to help!
#nationaldayofprayer
this spring marks 4yrs since the phoenix va crisis . we wont forget what happened to our great vets . choice is vital , but the program needs work & is running out of $ . congress must fix choice program by memorial day so vets can get the care they deserve . i will sign immediately!
today , it was my great honor to celebrate the #nationaldayofprayer at the @whitehouse , in the rose garden ! proclamation:
despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair . prior to its violation by ms . clifford and her attorney , this was a private agreement . money from the campaign , or campaign contributions , played no roll in this transaction.
very common among celebrities and people of wealth . in this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in arbitration for damages against ms . clifford daniels . the agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair , .
mr . cohen , an attorney , received a monthly retainer , not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign , from which he entered into , through reimbursement , a private contract between two parties , known as a non-disclosure agreement , or nda . these agreements are.
our great financial team is in china trying to negotiate a level playing field on trade ! i look forward to being with president xi in the not too distant future . we will always have a good great relationship!
ainsley earnhardt , a truly great person , just wrote a wonderful book , the light within me , which is doing really well . she is very special and so is her new book . bring it to number one!
as everybody is aware , the past administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a north korean labor camp , but to no avail . stay tuned!
this isn’t some game . you are screwing with the work of the president of the united states . john dowd , march 2018. with north korea , china , the middle east and so much more , there is not much time to be thinking about this , especially since there was no russian collusion.
i have been briefed on the u . s. c-130 hercules cargo plane from the puerto rico national guard that crashed near savannah hilton head international airport . please join me in thoughts and prayers for the victims , their families and the great men and women of the national guard.
congratulations @secpompeo !
a rigged system - they don’t want to turn over documents to congress . what are they afraid of ? why so much redacting ? why such unequal justice ? at some point i will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the presidency and get involved!
new book - a must read ! the russia hoax - the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump by the brilliant fox news legal analyst gregg jarrett . a sad chapter for law enforcement . a rigged system!
the questions are an intrusion into the president’s article 2 powers under the constitution to fire any executive branch employee . what the president was thinking is an outrageous . as to the president’s unfettered power to fire anyone . joe digenova , former us attorney
there was no collusion it is a hoax and there is no obstruction of justice that is a setup & trap . what there is is negotiations going on with north korea over nuclear war , negotiations going on with china over trade deficits , negotiations on nafta , and much more . witch hunt!
today , it was my great honor to thank and welcome heroic crew members and passengers of southwest airlines flight 1380 at the @whitehouse !
congratulations @armywp_football !
today i had the great honor of awarding the commander-in-chief’s trophy , for the first time in 21 years , to the @armywp_football black knights at the @whitehouse . congratulations!
yesterday , it was my great honor to welcome president @mbuhari of the federal republic of nigeria to the @whitehouse ! 🇺🇸🇳🇬
it would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened ! witch hunt!
delegation heading to china to begin talks on the massive trade deficit that has been created with our country . very much like north korea , this should have been fixed years ago , not now . same with other countries and nafta . but it will all get done . great potential for usa!
so disgraceful that the questions concerning the russian witch hunt were leaked to the media . no questions on collusion . oh , i see . you have a made up , phony crime , collusion , that never existed , and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information . nice!
the white house is running very smoothly despite phony witch hunts etc . there is great energy and unending stamina , both necessary to get things done . we are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so ! fake news is going bonkers!
the fake news is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources who don’t exist . they are totally unhinged , and the great success of this administration is making them do and say things that even they can’t believe they are saying . truly bad people!
during small business week , we celebrate the great , hard-working entrepreneurs across our country who have started and operate a small business!
the migrant ‘caravan’ that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective u . s. immigration laws are . yet democrats like jon tester continue to support the open borders agenda – tester even voted to protect sanctuary cities . we need lawmakers who will put america first.
i recently had a terrific meeting with a bipartisan group of freshman lawmakers who feel very strongly in favor of congressional term limits . i gave them my full support and endorsement for their efforts . #draintheswamp
numerous countries are being considered for the meeting , but would peace house/freedom house , on the border of north & south korea , be a more representative , important and lasting site than a third party country ? just asking!
the white house correspondents’ dinner is dead as we know it . this was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great country and all that it stands for . fake news is alive and well and beautifully represented on saturday night!
headline: kim prepared to cede nuclear weapons if u . s. pledges not to invade - from the failing new york times . also , will shut down nuclear test site in may.
the white house correspondents’ dinner was a failure last year , but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it . the filthy comedian totally bombed couldn’t even deliver her lines-much like the seth meyers weak performance . put dinner to rest , or start over!
trump’s triumphs are driving his critics crazy ! thank you steve hilton @nextrevfnc , just want to do what is right for our wonderful u . s.a.
just got recent poll - much higher than president o at same time . well , much more has been accomplished!
while washington , michigan , was a big success , washington , DC , just didn’t work . everyone is talking about the fact that the white house correspondents dinner was a very big , boring bust . the so-called comedian really bombed . @greggutfeld should host next year ! @petehegseth
great evening last night in washington , michigan . the enthusiasm , knowledge and love in that room was unreal . to the many thousands of people who couldn’t get in , i cherish you . and will be back!
join me live in washington , michigan at 7:00pme on @foxnews ! #maga
secret service has just informed me that senator jon tester’s statements on admiral jackson are not true . there were no such findings . a horrible thing that we in DC must live with , just like phony russian collusion . tester should lose race in montana . very dishonest and sick!
look forward to being in the great state of michigan tonight . major business expansion and jobs pouring into your state . auto companies expanding at record pace . big crowd tonight , will be live on t . v.
just had a long and very good talk with president moon of south korea . things are going very well , time and location of meeting with north korea is being set . also spoke to prime minister abe of japan to inform him of the ongoing negotiations.
clapper lied about fraudulent dossier leaks to cnn @foxandfriends foxnews he is a lying machine who now works for fake news cnn.
great people of montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being . admiral jackson is the kind of man that those in montana would most respect and admire , and now , for no reason whatsoever , his reputation has been shattered . not fair , tester!
allegations made by senator jon tester against admiral/doctor ron jackson are proving false . the secret service is unable to confirm in fact they deny any of the phony democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful jackson family . tester should resign . the.
house intelligence committee rules that there was no collusion between the trump campaign and russia . as i have been saying all along , it is all a big hoax by the democrats based on payments and lies . there should never have been a special counsel appointed . witch hunt!

i urge all americans to participate in #takebackday tomorrow ! let’s come together and beat last october’s record of disposed prescription pills ! visit to learn more on how to participate saturday and every day .
just out: house intelligence committee report released . no evidence that the trump campaign colluded , coordinated or conspired with russia . clinton campaign paid for opposition research obtained from russia- wow ! a total witch hunt ! must end now!
look forward to meeting with chancellor angela merkel of germany today . so much to discuss , so little time ! it will be good for both of our great countries!
kanye west has performed a great service to the black community - big things are happening and eyes are being opened for the first time in decades - legacy stuff ! thank you also to chance and dr . darrell scott , they really get it lowest black & hispanic unemployment in history.
please do not forget the great help that my good friend , president xi of china , has given to the united states , particularly at the border of north korea . without him it would have been a much longer , tougher , process!
so great to have staff sgt . dan nevins and the incredible wounded warriors with me in the white house yesterday . these are truly brave and special people ! @foxandfriends
korean war to end ! the united states , and all of its great people , should be very proud of what is now taking place in korea!
after a furious year of missile launches and nuclear testing , a historic meeting between north and south korea is now taking place . good things are happening , but only time will tell!
is everybody believing what is going on . james comey can’t define what a leak is . he illegally leaked classified information but doesn’t understand what he did or how serious it is . he lied all over the place to cover it up . he’s either very sick or very dumb . remember sailor!
the u . s. has put together a strong bid w/ canada & mexico for the 2026 world cup . it would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the u . s. bid . why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us including at the united nations?
loved being on @foxandfriends this morning . great show!
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00 a.m. enjoy!
maga !
thank you kanye , very cool !
looking forward to my meeting with tim cook of apple . we will be talking about many things , including how the u . s. has been treated unfairly for many years , by many countries , on trade.
@flotus did a spectacular job hosting the president of france @emmanuelmacron and his wife brigitte . every detail was done to perfection . the state dining room never looked more beautiful , and washington is abuzz over what an incredible job melania did.
busy day planned . looking forward to watching president macron of france address a joint session of congress today . this is a great honor and seldom allowed to be done . he will be great!
congratulations to republican debbie lesko on her big win in the special election for arizona house seat . debbie will do a great job ! press is so silent.
our two great republics are linked together by the timeless bonds of history , culture , and destiny . we are people who cherish our values , protect our civilization , and recognize the image of god in every human soul .
today , @flotus melania and i were honored to welcome french president @emmanuelmacron and mrs . brigitte macron to the @whitehouse . we look forward to hosting them at tonights state dinner , in their honor .
@jimrenacci has worked so hard on tax reductions , illegal immigration , the border and crime . i need jim very badly to help our agenda and to keep making america great again ! he will be a fantastic senator for the great state of ohio , and has my full endorsement!

president trump calls the u . s-france relationship ‘unbreakable . ’ history shows he’s right .
arizona , please get out today and vote @debbielesko for congress in #az08. strong on border , immigration and crime . great on the military . time is ticking down - get out and vote today . we need debbie in congress!
americans stand with you and all of canada , prime minister @justintrudeau . our thoughts and prayers are with you all . #torontostrong
having great meetings and discussions with my friend , president @emmanuelmacron of france . we are in the midst of meetings on iran , syria and trade . we will be holding a joint press conference shortly , here at the @whitehouse . 🇺🇸🇫🇷
here’s a great stat - since january 2017, the number of people forced to use food stamps is down 1.9 million . the american people are finally back to work!
mexico , whose laws on immigration are very tough , must stop people from going through mexico and into the u . s. we may make this a condition of the new nafta agreement . our country cannot accept what is happening ! also , we must get wall funding fast.
despite the democrat inspired laws on sanctuary cities and the border being so bad and one sided , i have instructed the secretary of homeland security not to let these large caravans of people into our country . it is a disgrace . we are the only country in the world so naive ! wall
hard to believe obstructionists may vote against mike pompeo for secretary of state . the dems will not approve hundreds of good people , including the ambassador to germany . they are maxing out the time on approval process for all , never happened before . need more republicans!
thank you to the incredible law enforcement officers from the palm beach county sheriff’s office . they keep us safe and are very cool about it !
kim strassel of the wsj just said , after reviewing the dumb comey memos , you got to ask , what was the purpose of the special counsel ? there’s no there there . dan henninger of the wsj said memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought!
funny how all of the pundits that couldn’t come close to making a deal on north korea are now all over the place telling me how to make a deal!
a complete witch hunt!
i can die happy now with trump job performance , stated mary matalin . a great overall president , stunning ! thank you mary.
we are a long way from conclusion on north korea , maybe things will work out , and maybe they won’t - only time will tell . but the work i am doing now should have been done a long time ago!
sleepy eyes chuck todd of fake news nbc just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with north korea , and they have given up nothing . wow , we haven’t given up anything & they have agreed to denuclearization so great for world , site closure , & no more testing!
gop lawmakers asking sessions to investigate comey and hillary clinton . @foxnews good luck with that request!
at least two memos comey shared with a friend contained classified information . wall street journal
the washington post said i refer to jeff sessions as mr . magoo and rod rosenstein as mr . peepers . this is according to people with whom the president has spoken . there are no such people and don’t know these characters . just more fake & disgusting news to create ill will!
james comey’s memos are classified , i did not declassify them . they belong to our government ! therefore , he broke the law ! additionally , he totally made up many of the things he said i said , and he is already a proven liar and leaker . where are memos on clinton , lynch & others?
sylvester stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion jack johnson . his trials and tribulations were great , his life complex and controversial . others have looked at this over the years , most thought it would be done , but yes , i am considering a full pardon!
so funny , the democrats have sued the republicans for winning . now he r’s counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material , including servers and emails!
heading to the southern white house to watch the funeral service of barbara bush . first lady melania has arrived in houston to pay our respects . will be a beautiful day!
today , my thoughts and prayers are with the entire bush family . in memory of first lady barbara bush , there is a remembrance display located at her portrait in the center hall of the @whitehouse .
fantastic crowd and great people yesterday in key west , florida . thank you !
join me in washington , michigan on saturday , april 28, 2018 at 7:00pm ! #maga tickets:
it means lying or making up stories . sorry , i don’t see michael doing that despite the horrible witch hunt and the dishonest media!
non-existent sources and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates michael , a fine person with a wonderful family . michael is a businessman for his own account/lawyer who i have always liked & respected . most people will flip if the government lets them out of trouble , even if.
the new york times and a third rate reporter named maggie haberman , known as a crooked h flunkie who i don’t speak to and have nothing to do with , are going out of their way to destroy michael cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will flip . they use.

a message from kim jong un: north korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles . also will shut down a nuclear test site in the country’s northern side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests . progress being made for all!
james comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a special council ? therefore , the special council was established based on an illegal act ? really , does everybody know what that means?
just heard the campaign was sued by the obstructionist democrats . this can be good news in that we will now counter for the dnc server that they refused to give to the fbi , the debbie wasserman schultz servers and documents held by the pakistani mystery man and clinton emails.
north korea has agreed to suspend all nuclear tests and close up a major test site . this is very good news for north korea and the world - big progress ! look forward to our summit.
just heard the campaign was sued by the obstructionist democrats . this can be good news in that we will now counter for the dnc server that they refused to give to the fbi , the wendy wasserman schultz servers and documents held by the pakistani mystery man and clinton emails.
can you believe that despite 93% bad stories from the fake news media should be getting good stories , today we had just about our highest poll numbers , including those on election day ? the american public is wise to the phony an dishonest press . make america great again!
looks like opec is at it again . with record amounts of oil all over the place , including the fully loaded ships at sea , oil prices are artificially very high ! no good and will not be accepted!
nancy pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big tax cuts given to the american people by the republicans . got not one democrat vote ! here’s a choice . they want to end them and raise your taxes substantially . republicans are working on making them permanent and more cuts!
so exciting ! i have agreed to be the commencement speaker at our great naval academy on may 25th in annapolis , maryland . looking forward to being there.
so general michael flynn’s life can be totally destroyed while shadey james comey can leak and lie and make lots of money from a third rate book that should never have been written . is that really the way life in america is supposed to work ? i don’t think so!
james comey memos just out and show clearly that there was no collusion and no obstruction . also , he leaked classified information . wow ! will the witch hunt continue?
james comey just threw andrew mccabe under the bus . inspector general’s report on mccabe is a disaster for both of them ! getting a little lot of their own medicine?
sanctuary cities released at least 142 gang members across the united states , making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed . we are doing a great job of law enforcement , but things such as this make safety in america difficult!
my thoughts , prayers and condolences are with the families , friends and colleagues of the two @gcsoflorida deputies heroes who lost their lives in the line of duty today.
mike pompeo is outstanding . first in his class at west point . a top student at harvard law school . a success at whatever he has done . we need the senate to approve mike asap . he will be a great secretary of state!
hopefully the senate will not leave washington until our ambassadors , judges and the people who make washington work are approved . the democrats are obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our country!
democrats are obstructing good hopefully great people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our government , hence , the american people . they are slow walking all of my nominations - hundreds of people . at this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals!
@marshablackburn is a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her . great on the military , border security and crime . loves and works hard for the people of tennessee . she has my full endorsement and i will be there to campaign with her!
thank you #jiatfsouth , @norad_northcom , @southcomwatch and @dhsgov . keep up the great work !
just arrived @naskeywest ! heading to a briefing with the joint interagency task force south , northcom and southcom .
governor jerry brown announced he will deploy up to 400 national guard troops to do nothing . the crime rate in california is high enough , and the federal government will not be paying for governor brown’s charade . we need border security and action , not words!
thank you san diego county for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against californias illegal and unconstitutional sanctuary policies . californias dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities , putting all americans at risk.
great meeting with prime minister abe of japan , who has just left florida . talked in depth about north korea , military and trade . good things will happen!
it was my great honor to host my friend @jpn_pmo @abeshinzo and his delegation at mar-a-lago for the past two days . lots accomplished , thank you ! #success🇺🇸🇯🇵
great working luncheon with u . s. and japanese delegations this afternoon !
prime minister @abeshinzo of japan and myself this morning building an even deeper and better relationship while playing a quick round of golf at trump international golf club .
best wishes to prime minister @netanyahu and all of the people of israel on the 70th anniversary of your great independence . we have no better friends anywhere . looking forward to moving our embassy to jerusalem next month!
slippery james comey , the worst fbi director in history , was not fired because of the phony russia investigation where , by the way , there was no collusion except by the dems!
mike pompeo met with kim jong un in north korea last week . meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed . details of summit are being worked out now . denuclearization will be a great thing for world , but also for north korea!
a sketch years later about a nonexistent man . a total con job , playing the fake news media for fools but they know it !
there is a revolution going on in california . soooo many sanctuary areas want out of this ridiculous , crime infested & breeding concept . jerry brown is trying to back out of the national guard at the border , but the people of the state are not happy . want security & safety now!
while japan and south korea would like us to go back into tpp , i don’t like the deal for the united states . too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn’t work . bilateral deals are far more efficient , profitable and better for our workers . look how bad wto is to u . s.
pastor andrew brunson , a fine gentleman and christian leader in the united states , is on trial and being persecuted in turkey for no reason . they call him a spy , but i am more a spy than he is . hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs!
it is my great honor to host @jpn_pmo @abeshinzo !
@flotus melania and i join the nation in celebrating the life of barbara bush:
@flotus melania and i join the nation in celebrating the life of barbara bush:
states and cities throughout our country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers . very unfair to traditional tax paying stores!
today’s court decision means that congress must close loopholes that block the removal of dangerous criminal aliens , including aggravated felons . this is a public safety crisis that can only be fixed by.
congress – house and senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from our society . keep america safe!
welcome prime minister abe !
rasmussen just came out at 51% approval despite the fake news media . they were one of the three most accurate on election day . just about the most inaccurate were cnn and abc news/washington post , and they haven’t changed get new pollsters . much of the media is a scam!
getting ready to meet prime minister abe of japan , a truly fine gentleman!
so many people are seeing the benefits of the tax cut bill . everyone is talking , really nice to see!
looks like jerry brown and california are not looking for safety and security along their very porous border . he cannot come to terms for the national guard to patrol and protect the border . the high crime rate will only get higher . much wanted wall in san diego already started!
i am in florida and looking forward to my meeting with prime minister abe of japan . working on trade and military security.
employment is up , taxes are down . enjoy!
russia and china are playing the currency devaluation game as the u . s. keeps raising interest rates . not acceptable!
comey drafted the crooked hillary exoneration long before he talked to her lied in congress to senator g , then based his decisions on her poll numbers . disgruntled , he , mccabe , and the others , committed many crimes!
just hit 50% in the rasmussen poll , much higher than president obama at same point . with all of the phony stories and fake news , it’s hard to believe ! thank you america , we are doing great things.
slippery james comey , a man who always ends up badly and out of whack he is not smart ! , will go down as the worst fbi director in history , by far!
attorney client privilege is now a thing of the past . i have many too many ! lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices , and even homes , are going to be raided with everything , including their phones and computers , taken . all lawyers are deflated and concerned!
i never asked comey for personal loyalty . i hardly even knew this guy . just another of his many lies . his memos are self serving and fake!
the syrian raid was so perfectly carried out , with such precision , that the only way the fake news media could demean was by my use of the term mission accomplished . i knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great military term , it should be brought back . use often!
comey throws ag lynch under the bus ! why can’t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with wild bill and lynch ? was she promised a supreme court seat , or ag , in order to lay off hillary . no golf and grandkids talk give us all a break!
the big questions in comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like , how come he gave up classified information jail , why did he lie to congress jail , why did the dnc refuse to give server to the fbi why didn’t they take it , why the phony memos , mccabe’s $700,000 & more?
unbelievably , james comey states that polls , where crooked hillary was leading , were a factor in the handling stupidly of the clinton email probe . in other words , he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win , and he wanted a job . slimeball!
so proud of our great military which will soon be , after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars , the finest that our country has ever had . there won’t be anything , or anyone , even close!
a perfectly executed strike last night . thank you to france and the united kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine military . could not have had a better result . mission accomplished!
doj just issued the mccabe report - which is a total disaster . he lied ! lied ! lied ! mccabe was totally controlled by comey - mccabe is comey ! ! no collusion , all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes!
we are bringing back our factories , we are bringing back our jobs , and we are bringing back those four beautiful words: made in the usa !
untruthful slime ball who was , as time has proven , a terrible director of the fbi . his handling of the crooked hillary clinton case , and the events surrounding it , will go down as one of the worst botch jobs of history . it was my great honor to fire james comey!
james comey is a proven leaker & liar . virtually everyone in washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was , in fact , fired . he leaked classified information , for which he should be prosecuted . he lied to congress under oath . he is a weak and.
tremendous pressure is building , like never before , for the border wall and an end to crime cradling sanctuary cities . started the wall in san diego , where the people were pushing really hard to get it . they will soon be protected!
would only join tpp if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to pres . obama . we already have bilateral deals with six of the eleven nations in tpp , and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those nations , japan , who has hit us hard on trade for years!
america’s greatest treasure is our people – and my administration hears your voice and has your back . we are fighting to give every american a future of dignity , purpose and pride . american spirit is back ! #taxcuts
thank you to all of the american workers who travelled here today ! this event is dedicated to you: the hardworking americans who make this nation run . you love your country , you provide for your family , you have pride in your work and you cherish our great american flag ! #taxcuts
just had an agricultural roundtable with memembers of congress and governors . i will be making remarks on the large scale tax cuts given to american families and workers at 1:45 p.m. from the rose garden . join me live:
i have agreed with the historically cooperative , disciplined approach that we have engaged in with robert mueller unlike the clintons ! . i have full confidence in ty cobb , my special counsel , and have been fully advised throughout each phase of this process.
on yom hashoah we remember the six million jews slaughtered in the holocaust . with each passing year , our duty to remember this atrocity increases as we pledge #neveragain . #holocaustremembranceday
good luck to mike pompeo during his confirmation hearing today . he will be a great secretary of state!
never said when an attack on syria would take place . could be very soon or not so soon at all ! in any event , the united states , under my administration , has done a great job of ridding the region of isis . where is our thank you america?
california governor jerry brown is doing the right thing and sending the national guard to the border . thank you jerry , good move for the safety of our country!
if i wanted to fire robert mueller in december , as reported by the failing new york times , i would have fired him . just more fake news from a biased newspaper!
big show tonight on @seanhannity ! 9:00 p.m. on @foxnews
honored to have republican congressional leadership join me at the @whitehouse this evening . lots to discuss as we continue making america great again !
trump just took a giant step towards actual welfare reform
the @whitehouse is partnering with @interior and @natlparkservice to bring the @nscsafetys prescribed to death opioid memorial to the ellipse - beginning tomorrow , april 12th to april 18th . more information:
speaker paul ryan is a truly good man , and while he will not be seeking re-election , he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question . we are with you paul!
much of the bad blood with russia is caused by the fake & corrupt russia investigation , headed up by the all democrat loyalists , or people that worked for obama . mueller is most conflicted of all except rosenstein who signed fisa & comey letter . no collusion , so they go crazy!
our relationship with russia is worse now than it has ever been , and that includes the cold war . there is no reason for this . russia needs us to help with their economy , something that would be very easy to do , and we need all nations to work together . stop the arms race?
russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at syria . get ready russia , because they will be coming , nice and new and smart ! you shouldn’t be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it!
doing things that nobody thought possible , despite the never ending and corrupt russia investigation , which takes tremendous time and focus . no collusion or obstruction other than i fight back , so now they do the unthinkable , and raid a lawyers office for information ! bad!
so much fake news about what is going on in the white house . very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with china , the coming north korea meeting and , of course , the vicious gas attack in syria . feels great to have bolton & larry k on board . i we are
the failing new york times wrote another phony story . it was political pundit doug schoen , not a ukrainian businessman , who asked me to do a short speech by phone skype , hosted by doug , in ukraine . i was very positive about ukraine-another negative to the fake russia c story!
today , it was my great honor to welcome the 2017 ncaa football national champion , alabama crimson tide - to the white house . congratulations ! #rolltide
very thankful for president xi of china’s kind words on tariffs and automobile barriers . also , his enlightenment on intellectual property and technology transfers . we will make great progress together!
very thankful for president xi of china’s kind words on tarrifs and automobile barriers . also , his enlightenment on intellectual property and technology transfers . we will make great progress together!
last night , it was my great honor to host america’s senior defense and military leaders for dinner at the white house . america’s military is the greatest fighting force in the history of the world . they all have my pledge of unwavering commitment to our men and women in uniform !
a total witch hunt ! !!
attorney–client privilege is dead!
great @cabinet meeting at the @whitehouse this morning !
the democrats are not doing what’s right for our country . i will not rest until we have secured our borders and restored the rule of law !
when a car is sent to the united states from china , there is a tariff to be paid of 2 1/2% . when a car is sent to china from the united states , there is a tariff to be paid of 25% . does that sound like free or fair trade . no , it sounds like stupid trade - going on for years!
congratulations to patrick reed on his great and courageous masters win ! when patrick had his amazing win at doral 5 years ago , people saw his great talent , and a bright future ahead . now he is the masters champion!
if president obama had crossed his stated red line in the sand , the syrian disaster would have ended long ago ! animal assad would have been history!
to pay . open area immediately for medical help and verification . another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever . sick!
many dead , including women and children , in mindless chemical attack in syria . area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by syrian army , making it completely inaccessible to outside world . president putin , russia and iran are responsible for backing animal assad . big price.
president xi and i will always be friends , no matter what happens with our dispute on trade . china will take down its trade barriers because it is the right thing to do . taxes will become reciprocal & a deal will be made on intellectual property . great future for both countries!
the washington post is far more fiction than fact . story after story is made up garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting . always quoting sources not names , many of which don’t exist . story on john kelly isn’t true , just another hit job!
the washington post is far more fiction than fact . story after story is made up made garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting . always quoting sources not names , many of which don’t exist . story on john kelly isn’t true . just another hit job!
the fbi closed the case on hillary , which was a rigged investigation . they exonerated her even before they ever interviewed her , they never even put her under oath . and much more . so true jesse ! @wattersworld
while security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor , scott pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at epa . record clean air & water while saving usa billions of dollars . rent was about market rate , travel expenses ok . scott is doing a great job!
fire at trump tower is out . very confined well built building . firemen and women did a great job . thank you!
what does the department of justice and fbi have to hide ? why aren’t they giving the strongly requested documents unredacted to the house judiciary committee ? stalling , but for what reason ? not looking good!
lawmakers of the house judiciary committee are angrily accusing the department of justice of missing the thursday deadline for turning over unredacted documents relating to fisa abuse , fbi , comey , lynch , mccabe , clinton emails and much more . slow walking - what is going on ? bad!
we are sealing up our southern border . the people of our great country want safety and security . the dems have been a disaster on this very important issue!
the united states hasn’t had a trade surplus with china in 40 years . they must end unfair trade , take down barriers and charge only reciprocal tariffs . the u . s. is losing $500 billion a year , and has been losing billions of dollars for decades . cannot continue!
just spoke to @justintrudeau to pay my highest respect and condolences to the families of the terrible humboldt team tragedy . may god be with them all!
congratulations to @bernieandsid on their new @77wabcradio morning radio show in new york city . it was an honor to join you two – good luck !
bet founder: trumps economy is bringing black workers back into the labor force
america is open for business !
do you believe that the fake news media is pushing hard on a story that i am going to replace a . g. jeff sessions with epa chief scott pruitt , who is doing a great job but is totally under siege ? do people really believe this stuff ? so much of the media is dishonest and corrupt!
china , which is a great economic power , is considered a developing nation within the world trade organization . they therefore get tremendous perks and advantages , especially over the u . s. does anybody think this is fair . we were badly represented . the wto is unfair to u . s.
despite the aluminum tariffs , aluminum prices are down 4% . people are surprised , i’m not ! lots of money coming into u . s. coffers and jobs , jobs , jobs!
thank you @wvgovernor jim justice . it was my great honor to be with the amazing people of west virginia today ! #maga
thanks to our historic tax cuts , america is open for business , and millions of american workers are seeing more take-home pay through higher wages , salaries and bonuses !
the fake news washington post , amazon’s chief lobbyist , has another of many phony headlines , trump defiant as china adds trade penalties . wrong ! should read , trump defiant as u . s. adds trade penalties , will end barriers and massive i . p. theft . typically bad reporting!
the caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our border . because of the trump administrations actions , border crossings are at a still unacceptable 46 year low . stop drugs!
still rising: rasmussen poll shows donald trump approval ratings now at 51 percent
today we honor dr . martin luther king , jr . on the 50th anniversary of his assassination . earlier this year i spoke about dr . king’s legacy of justice and peace , and his impact on uniting americans . #mlk50 proclamation:
our thoughts and prayers are with the four u . s. marines from the 3rd marine aircraft wing who lost their lives in yesterday’s southern california helicopter crash . we pray for their families , and our great @usmc.
when you’re already $500 billion down , you can’t lose!
we are not in a trade war with china , that war was lost many years ago by the foolish , or incompetent , people who represented the u . s. now we have a trade deficit of $500 billion a year , with intellectual property theft of another $300 billion . we cannot let this continue!
our border laws are very weak while those of mexico & canada are very strong . congress must change these obama era , and other , laws now ! the democrats stand in our way - they want people to pour into our country unchecked . crime ! we will be taking strong action today.
was just briefed on the shooting at youtube’s hq in san bruno , california . our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved . thank you to our phenomenal law enforcement officers and first responders that are currently on the scene.
we will protect our southern border !
today , it was my honor to welcome estonia president @kerstikaljulaid , lithuania president @grybauskaite_lt , and latvia president @vejonis to the @whitehouse . congratulations on your 100th anniversaries of independence ! #balticsummit:
i am right about amazon costing the united states post office massive amounts of money for being their delivery boy . amazon should pay these costs plus and not have them bourne by the american taxpayer . many billions of dollars . p . o. leaders don’t have a clue or do they ? !
thank you to rasmussen for the honest polling . just hit 50% , which is higher than cheatin’ obama at the same time in his administration.
check out the fact that you can’t get a job at ratings challenged @cnn unless you state that you are totally anti-trump ? little jeff zuker , whose job is in jeopardy , is not having much fun lately . they should clean up and strengthen cnn and get back to honest reporting!
the big caravan of people from honduras , now coming across mexico and heading to our weak laws border , had better be stopped before it gets there . cash cow nafta is in play , as is foreign aid to honduras and the countries that allow this to happen . congress must act now!
the fake news networks , those that knowingly have a sick and biased agenda , are worried about the competition and quality of sinclair broadcast . the fakers at cnn , nbc , abc & cbs have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction!
#autismawarenessday #lightitupblue
president trumps approval rate among likely u . s. voters hit 50 percent on monday , which puts him higher than former president barack obamas score at the same point into his first term , according to a new poll . via: @anna_giaritelli @dcexaminer
39% of my nominations , including diplomats to foreign lands , have not been confirmed due to democrat obstruction and delay . at this rate , it would take more than 7 years before i am allowed to have these great people start working . never happened before . disgraceful!
honduras , mexico and many other countries that the u . s. is very generous to , sends many of their people to our country through our weak immigration policies . caravans are heading here . must pass tough laws and build the wall . democrats allow open borders , drugs and crime!
as ridiculous as it sounds , the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our southern border back where they came from . a whole big wasted procedure must take place . mexico & canada have tough immigration laws , whereas ours are an obama joke . act congress
president donald j . trump proclaims april 2, 2018, world autism awareness day
an honor to host the annual @whitehouse easter egg roll !
so sad that the department of justice and the fbi are slow walking , or even not giving , the unredacted documents requested by congress . an embarrassment to our country!
only fools , or worse , are saying that our money losing post office makes money with amazon . they lose a fortune , and this will be changed . also , our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country . not a level playing field!
so funny to watch fake news networks , among the most dishonest groups of people i have ever dealt with , criticize sinclair broadcasting for being biased . sinclair is far superior to cnn and even more fake nbc , which is a total joke.
mexico is making a fortune on nafta . they have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic . with all of the money they make from the u . s. , hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours , at least until congress changes our immigration laws!
daca is dead because the democrats didn’t care or act , and now everyone wants to get onto the daca bandwagon . no longer works . must build wall and secure our borders with proper border legislation . democrats want no borders , hence drugs and crime!
congress must immediately pass border legislation , use nuclear option if necessary , to stop the massive inflow of drugs and people . border patrol agents and ice are great , but the weak dem laws don’t allow them to do their job . act now congress , our country is being stolen!
mexico has the absolute power not to let these large caravans of people enter their country . they must stop them at their northern border , which they can do because their border laws work , not allow them to pass through into our country , which has no effective border laws.
these big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of daca . they want in on the act!
mexico is doing very little , if not nothing , at stopping people from flowing into mexico through their southern border , and then into the u . s. they laugh at our dumb immigration laws . they must stop the big drug and people flows , or i will stop their cash cow , nafta . need wall!
border patrol agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the border because of ridiculous liberal democrat laws like catch & release . getting more dangerous . caravans coming . republicans must go to nuclear option to pass tough laws now . no more daca deal!
happy easter!
governor jerry moonbeam brown pardoned 5 criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include 1 kidnapping and robbery 2 badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize 3 dealing drugs . is this really what the great people of california want ? @foxnews
does not include the fake washington post , which is used as a lobbyist and should so register . if the p . o. increased its parcel rates , amazon’s shipping costs would rise by $2.6 billion . this post office scam must stop . amazon must pay real costs and taxes now!
while we are on the subject , it is reported that the u . s. post office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for amazon . that amounts to billions of dollars . the failing n . y. times reports that the size of the company’s lobbying staff has ballooned , and that.
washington spent trillions building up foreign countries while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair . no more ! its time to rebuild , and we will do it with american workers , american grit , and american pride !
jobs , jobs , jobs ! unemployment claims have fallen to a 45-year low . together , we are making the economy great again !
we are going to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure , and there is no better place to begin this campaign than in the great state of ohio . a tremendous honor to be here today at a state-of-the-art training site , where the skills of the american worker are forged and refined !
i have stated my concerns with amazon long before the election . unlike others , they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments , use our postal system as their delivery boy causing tremendous loss to the u . s. , and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!
in the interim , hon . robert wilkie of dod will serve as acting secretary . i am thankful for dr . david shulkin’s service to our country and to our great veterans!
i am pleased to announce that i intend to nominate highly respected admiral ronny l . jackson , md , as the new secretary of veterans affairs.
great briefing this afternoon on the start of our southern border wall !
release known dangerous criminals into communities across the state . all citizens have the right to be protected by federal law and strong borders.
my administration stands in solidarity with the brave citizens in orange county defending their rights against californias illegal and unconstitutional sanctuary policies . californias sanctuary laws.
@ustraderep just announced an agreement in principle with south korea on korus ! a great deal for american and korean workers . let’s now focus on our important security relationship.
received message last night from xi jinping of china that his meeting with kim jong un went very well and that kim looks forward to his meeting with me . in the meantime , and unfortunately , maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost!
for years and through many administrations , everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the korean peninsula was not even a small possibility . now there is a good chance that kim jong un will do what is right for his people and for humanity . look forward to our meeting!
the second amendment will never be repealed ! as much as democrats would like to see this happen , and despite the words yesterday of former supreme court justice stevens , no way . we need more republicans in 2018 and must always hold the supreme court!
i am very pleased to welcome the opioid memorial to the presidents park in april . i encourage all to visit and remember those who we have lost to this deadly epidemic . we will keep fighting until we defeat the opioid crisis !
trade talks going on with numerous countries that , for many years , have not treated the united states fairly . in the end , all will be happy!
great news ! #maga
so much fake news . never been more voluminous or more inaccurate . but through it all , our country is doing great!
the economy is looking really good . it has been many years that we have seen these kind of numbers . the underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better.
@howiecarrshow just wrote a book which everyone is talking about . he was a great help . he is a veteran journalist who had a great influence in nh and beyond . he calls it the most amazing political campaign of modern times . the book is called , what really happened . enjoy ! #maga
president donald j . trump proclaims march 25, 2018, as greek independence day: a national day of celebration of greek and american democracy
happy national #medalofhonorday to our heroes . we love you !
lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed if for no other reason than they can bill more , which is unfair to our great country - and i am very happy with my existing team . besides , there was no collusion with russia , except by crooked hillary and the dems!
many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the russia case . don’t believe the fake news narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on . fame & fortune will never be turned down by a lawyer , though some are conflicted . problem is that a new.
much can be done with the $1.6 billion given to building and fixing the border wall . it is just a down payment . work will start immediately . the rest of the money will come - and remember daca , the democrats abandoned you but we will not!
because of the $700 & $716 billion dollars gotten to rebuild our military , many jobs are created and our military is again rich . building a great border wall , with drugs poison and enemy combatants pouring into our country , is all about national defense . build wall through m!
france honors a great hero . officer died after bravely swapping places with hostage in isis related terror attack . so much bravery around the world constantly fighting radical islamic terrorism . even stronger measures needed , especially at borders!
our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the horrible attack in france yesterday , and we grieve the nation’s loss . we also condemn the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support . we are with you @emmanuelmacron!
as a matter of national security ive signed the omnibus spending bill . i say to congress: i will never sign another bill like this again . to prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again , im calling on congress to give me a line-item veto for all govt spending bills !
obama administration legalized bump stocks . bad idea . as i promised , today the department of justice will issue the rule banning bump stocks with a mandated comment period . we will ban all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
news conference at the white house concerning the omnibus spending bill . 1:00 p.m.
i am considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus daca recipients have been totally abandoned by the democrats not even mentioned in bill and the border wall , which is desperately needed for our national defense , is not fully funded.
daca was abandoned by the democrats . very unfair to them ! would have been tied to desperately needed wall.
house intelligence committee votes to release final report . findings: 1 no evidence provided of collusion between trump campaign & russia . 2 the obama administrations post election response was insufficient . 3 clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts.
i am pleased to announce that , effective 4/9/18, @ambjohnbolton will be my new national security advisor . i am very thankful for the service of general h . r. mcmaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend . there will be an official contact handover on 4/9.
my honor charlie - thank you ! #maga
as a candidate , i pledged that if elected i would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade , protect american workers , and defend our national security . today , we took another critical step to fulfill that commitment .
remember when they were saying , during the campaign , that donald trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds , but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as crooked hillary’s large and highly sophisticated staff . well , not saying that anymore!
crazy joe biden is trying to act like a tough guy . actually , he is weak , both mentally and physically , and yet he threatens me , for the second time , with physical assault . he doesn’t know me , but he would go down fast and hard , crying all the way . don’t threaten people joe!
democrats refused to take care of daca . would have been so easy , but they just didn’t care . i had to fight for military and start of wall.
got $1.6 billion to start wall on southern border , rest will be forthcoming . most importantly , got $700 billion to rebuild our military , $716 billion next year . most ever . had to waste money on dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.
they can help solve problems with north korea , syria , ukraine , isis , iran and even the coming arms race . bush tried to get along , but didn’t have the smarts . obama and clinton tried , but didn’t have the energy or chemistry remember reset . peace through strength!
i called president putin of russia to congratulate him on his election victory in past , obama called him also . the fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him . they are wrong ! getting along with russia and others is a good thing , not a bad thing.
special council is told to find crimes , whether a crime exists or not . i was opposed to the selection of mueller to be special council . i am still opposed to it . i think president trump was right when he said there never should have been a special council appointed because.
there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime , collusion or otherwise , or obstruction of justice ! so stated by harvard law professor alan dershowitz.
special council is told to find crimes , wether crimes exist or not . i was opposed the the selection of mueller to be special council , i still am opposed to it . i think president trump was right when he said there never should have been a special council appointed because.
department of justice should have urged the supreme court to at least hear the drivers license case on illegal immigrants in arizona . i agree with @loudobbs . should have sought review.
austin bombing suspect is dead . great job by law enforcement and all concerned!
our nation was founded by farmers . our independence was won by farmers . and our continent was tamed by farmers . our farmers always lead the way - we are proud of them , and we are delivering for them ! #nationalagricultureday
the democrats do not want to help daca . would be so easy to make a deal!
a total witch hunt with massive conflicts of interest!
@seanhannity on @foxandfriends now ! great ! 8:18 a.m.
why does the mueller team have 13 hardened democrats , some big crooked hillary supporters , and zero republicans ? another dem recently added . does anyone think this is fair ? and yet , there is no collusion!
spent very little time with andrew mccabe , but he never took notes when he was with me . i don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda , probably at a later date . same with lying james comey . can we call them fake memos?
wow , watch comey lie under oath to senator g when asked have you ever been an anonymous source . or known someone else to be an anonymous source . ? he said strongly never , no . he lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.
the mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime . it was based on fraudulent activities and a fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc , and improperly used in fisa court for surveillance of my campaign . witch hunt!
the fake news is beside themselves that mccabe was caught , called out and fired . how many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife’s campaign by crooked h friend , terry m , who was also under investigation ? how many lies ? how many leaks ? comey knew it all , and much more!
as the house intelligence committee has concluded , there was no collusion between russia and the trump campaign . as many are now finding out , however , there was tremendous leaking , lying and corruption at the highest levels of the fbi , justice & state . #draintheswamp
happy #stpatricksday
andrew mccabe fired , a great day for the hard working men and women of the fbi - a great day for democracy . sanctimonious james comey was his boss and made mccabe look like a choirboy . he knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the fbi!

it was my honor to welcome prime minister leo varadkar of ireland to the @whitehouse !
we do have a trade deficit with canada , as we do with almost all countries some of them massive . p.m. justin trudeau of canada , a very good guy , doesn’t like saying that canada has a surplus vs . the u . s.negotiating , but they do . they almost all do . and that’s how i know!
larry kudlow will be my chief economic advisor as director of the national economic council . our country will have many years of great economic & financial success , with low taxes , unparalleled innovation , fair trade and an ever expanding labor force leading the way ! #maga

together , we are making america great again !

perhaps at no time in history have the business fundamentals of u . s. companies been better than they are today!
hundreds of good people , including very important ambassadors and judges , are being blocked and/or slow walked by the democrats in the senate . many important positions in government are unfilled because of this obstruction . worst in u . s. history!
all across this nation , we pray for our country and we thank god for our united states marines ! thank you . god bless you . and god bless america !
it was my great honor to deliver a message at the marine corps air station miramar to our great u . s. military , straight from the heart of the american people: we support you , we thank you , we love you - and we will always have your back !

if we don’t have a wall system , we’re not going to have a country . congress must fund the border wall & prohibit grants to sanctuary jurisdictions that threaten the security of our country & the people of our country . we must enforce our laws & protect our people ! #buildthewall
california’s sanctuary policies are illegal and unconstitutional and put the safety and security of our entire nation at risk . thousands of dangerous & violent criminal aliens are released as a result of sanctuary policies , set free to prey on innocent americans . this must stop!
according to the center for immigration studies , the $18 billion wall will pay for itself by curbing the importation of crime , drugs and illegal immigrants who tend to go on the federal dole .
heading to see the border wall prototypes in california !
mike pompeo , director of the cia , will become our new secretary of state . he will do a fantastic job ! thank you to rex tillerson for his service ! gina haspel will become the new director of the cia , and the first woman so chosen . congratulations to all!

the house intelligence committee has , after a 14 month long in-depth investigation , found no evidence of collusion or coordination between the trump campaign and russia to influence the 2016 presidential election.
it was my great honor to welcome the 2017 world series champion houston @astros to the @whitehouse ! #houstonstrong
the pittsburgh post gazette just endorsed rick saccone for congress . he will be much better for steel and business . very strong on experience and what our country needs . lamb will always vote for pelosi and dems . will raise taxes , weak on crime and border.
if schools are mandated to be gun free zones , violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter . almost all school shootings are in gun free zones . cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!

very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by white house . legislation moving forward . bump stocks will soon be out . highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry , subject to state law . armed guards ok , deterrent ! .
secretary of commerce wilbur ross will be speaking with representatives of the european union about eliminating the large tariffs and barriers they use against the u . s.a . not fair to our farmers and manufacturers.
rasmussen and others have my approval ratings at around 50% , which is higher than obama , and yet the political pundits love saying my approval ratings are somewhat low . they know they are lying when they say it . turn off the show - fake news!
the democrats continue to obstruct the confirmation of hundreds of good and talented people who are needed to run our government . a record in u . s. history . state department , ambassadors and many others are being slow walked . senate must approve now!
the republicans are 5-0 in recent congressional races , a point which the fake news media continuously fails to mention . i backed and campaigned for all of the winners . they give me credit for one . hopefully , rick saccone will be another big win on tuesday.
have shown conclusively that there was no collusion with russia . just excuse for losing . the only collusion was that done by the dnc , the democrats and crooked hillary . the writer of the story , maggie haberman , a hillary flunky , knows nothing about me and is not given access.
the failing new york times purposely wrote a false story stating that i am unhappy with my legal team on the russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out . wrong . i am very happy with my lawyers , john dowd , ty cobb and jay sekulow . they are doing a great job and.

the european union , wonderful countries who treat the u . s. very badly on trade , are complaining about the tariffs on steel & aluminum . if they drop their horrific barriers & tariffs on u . s. products going in , we will likewise drop ours . big deficit . if not , we tax cars etc . fair!
in the first hours after hearing that north korea’s leader wanted to meet with me to talk denuclearization and that missile launches will end , the press was startled & amazed . they couldn’t believe it . but by the following morning the news became fake . they said so what , who cares!
north korea has not conducted a missile test since november 28, 2017 and has promised not to do so through our meetings . i believe they will honor that commitment!
heading to moon township , pennsylvania , to be with a really good person , state representative rick saccone , who is running for congress . big & happy crowd why not , some of the best economic numbers ever . rick will help me a lot . also , tough on crime & border . loves 2nd a & vets

happy #internationalwomensday first lady melania trump to present the 2018 international women of courage award
looking forward to 3:30 p.m. meeting today at the white house . we have to protect & build our steel and aluminum industries while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends and treat us fairly on both trade and the military.
the u . s. is acting swiftly on intellectual property theft . we cannot allow this to happen as it has for many years!
china has been asked to develop a plan for the year of a one billion dollar reduction in their massive trade deficit with the united states . our relationship with china has been a very good one , and we look forward to seeing what ideas they come back with . we must act soon!
from bush 1 to present , our country has lost more than 55,000 factories , 6,000,000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated trade deficits of more than 12 trillion dollars . last year we had a trade deficit of almost 800 billion dollars . bad policies & leadership . must win again ! #maga

great couple , great book !
will be making a decision soon on the appointment of new chief economic advisor . many people wanting the job - will choose wisely!
possible progress being made in talks with north korea . for the first time in many years , a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned . the world is watching and waiting ! may be false hope , but the u . s. is ready to go hard in either direction!
federal judge in maryland has just ruled that president trump has the right to end daca . president obama had 8 years to fix this problem , and didn’t . i am waiting for the dems , they are running for the hills!
lowest rated oscars in history . problem is , we don’t have stars anymore - except your president just kidding , of course!
we will see what happens !
we are getting it done - jobs and security !
total inaction on daca by dems . where are you ? a deal can be made!
the new fake news narrative is that there is chaos in the white house . wrong ! people will always come & go , and i want strong dialogue before making a final decision . i still have some people that i want to change always seeking perfection . there is no chaos , only great energy!
it’s march 5th and the democrats are nowhere to be found on daca . gave them 6 months , they just don’t care . where are they ? we are ready to make a deal!
why did the obama administration start an investigation into the trump campaign with zero proof of wrongdoing long before the election in november ? wanted to discredit so crooked h would win . unprecedented . bigger than watergate ! plus , obama did nothing about russian meddling.
to protect our country we must protect american steel ! #america first
treat our farmers much better . highly restrictive . mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the u . s. they have not done what needs to be done . millions of people addicted and dying.
we have large trade deficits with mexico and canada . nafta , which is under renegotiation right now , has been a bad deal for u . s.a . massive relocation of companies & jobs . tariffs on steel and aluminum will only come off if new & fair nafta agreement is signed . also , canada must.
we are on the losing side of almost all trade deals . our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the u . s. for many years . our steel and aluminum industries are dead . sorry , it’s time for a change ! make america great again!
the gridiron dinner last night was great fun . i am accomplishing a lot in washington and have never had a better time doing something , and especially since this is for the american people!
if the e . u. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on u . s. companies doing business there , we will simply apply a tax on their cars which freely pour into the u . s. they make it impossible for our cars and more to sell there . big trade imbalance!
the united states has an $800 billion dollar yearly trade deficit because of our very stupid trade deals and policies . our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years . they laugh at what fools our leaders have been . no more!
mainstream media in u . s. is being mocked all over the world . they’ve gone crazy !
happy national anthem day !
heading to billy graham funeral . a special man!
rest in peace billy graham !
when a country taxes our products coming in at , say , 50% , and we tax the same product coming into our country at zero , not fair or smart . we will soon be starting reciprocal taxes so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us . $800 billion trade deficit-have no choice!
we must protect our country and our workers . our steel industry is in bad shape . if you don’t have steel , you don’t have a country!
eric , we are all with you and your family ! look forward to seeing you back on t . v.
alec baldwin , whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me on snl , now says playing me was agony . alec , it was agony for those who were forced to watch . bring back darrell hammond , funnier and a far greater talent!
when a country usa is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with , trade wars are good , and easy to win . example , when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute , don’t trade anymore-we win big . it’s easy!
alex baldwin , whose dieing mediocre career was saved by his impersonation of me on snl , now says playing djt was agony for him . alex , it was also agony for those who were forced to watch . you were terrible . bring back darrell hammond , much funnier and a far greater talent!
good great meeting in the oval office tonight with the nra!
manufacturing growing at the fastest pace in almost two decades!
jobless claims at a 49 year low!
together , we will face this challenge as a national family with conviction , with unity , and with a commitment to love and support our neighbors in times of dire need . working together , we will defeat this #opioidepidemic . full opioid summit:
consumer confidence in february highest since november 2000
manufacturing in u . s. expands at fastest pace since may 2004
unemployment filings are at their lowest level in over 48 years . great news for workers and jobs , jobs , jobs ! #maga
our steel and aluminum industries and many others have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world . we must not let our country , companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer . we want free , fair and smart trade!
many ideas , some good & some not so good , emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the white house . background checks a big part of conversation . gun free zones are proven targets of killers . after many years , a bill should emerge . respect 2nd amendment!
it was an honor to welcome bipartisan members of congress for a discussion on safe schools and safe communities . as we continue to mourn the loss of so many precious young lives in parkland , we are determined to turn our grief into action . full meeting:
today we honor billy graham as only three private citizens before him have been honored . we say a prayer for our country: that all across this land , the lord will raise up men and women like billy graham to spread a message of love and hope to every precious child of god .
starting at a small bible school in florida , billy graham soon led a nationwide revival . from a large tent in los angeles , to one hundred thousand people in a single day at yankee stadium , to more than two million people at madison square garden over sixteen weeks in 1957.
today , in the center of this great chamber lies billy graham – an ambassador for christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of god’s grace .
why is a . g. jeff sessions asking the inspector general to investigate potentially massive fisa abuse . will take forever , has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on comey etc . isn’t the i . g. an obama guy ? why not use justice department lawyers ? disgraceful!
45 year low on illegal border crossings this year . ice and border patrol agents are doing a great job for our country . ms-13 thugs being hit hard.
i have decided that sections of the wall that california wants built now will not be built until the whole wall is approved . big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed . our country must have border security!
the heritage foundation has just stated that 64% of the trump agenda is already done , faster than even ronald reagan . we’re blown away , said thomas binion of heritage , president trump is very active , very conservative and very effective . huge volume & spectrum of issues.
big legal win today . u . s. judge sided with the trump administration and rejected the attempt to stop the government from building a great border wall on the southern border . now this important project can go forward!
such a beautiful map , thank you !
@senatorwicker of mississippi has been a great supporter and incredible help in getting our massive tax cut bill done and approved . also big help on cutting regs . i am with him in his re-election all the way!
texas lc george p . bush backed me when it wasn’t the politically correct thing to do , and i back him now . also , ac sid miller has been with me from the beginning , he is trump’s man in texas . also support comptroller glenn hegar , and railroad commissioner christi craddick.
american consumers are the most confident theyve been since 2000.a strong job market is boosting confidence . the unemployment rate has stayed at a 17-year low .
i want to encourage all of my many texas friends to vote in the primary for governor greg abbott , senator ted cruz , lt . gov . dan patrick , and attorney general ken paxton . they are helping me to make america great again ! vote early or on march 6th.
witch hunt!
we’ve seen no evidence of collusion . i have seen nothing , the firing of james comey and all of the aftermath , that suggests that the president has obstructed justice because he’s exercising his power as the president of the u . s. i just don’t see it . judge ken starr
i’ve been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year . i just don’t see the evidence . in terms of the collusion , it’s all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have . jonathan turley on @foxnews
he’s got a very good point . somebody in the justice department has a treasure trove of evidence of mrs . clinton’s criminality at her own hands , or through others , that ought to be investigated . i fully agree with the president on that . @judgenapolitano on @marthamaccallum show
i will be interviewed by @judgejeanine on @foxnews at 9:00 p.m. enjoy!
congressman schiff omitted and distorted key facts @foxnews so , what else is new . he is a total phony!
russians had no compromising information on donald trump @foxnews of course not , because there is none , and never was . this whole witch hunt is an illegal disgrace . and obama did nothing about russia!
dem memo: fbi did not disclose who the clients were - the clinton campaign and the dnc . wow!
the democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal bust . just confirms all of the terrible things that were done . so illegal!
big cpac straw poll results: 93% approve of the job president trump is doing thank you ! . 50% say president trump should tweet more or same funny ! . 79% say republicans in congress should do a better job of working with president trump starting to happen.
dems are no longer talking daca ! out of sight , out of mind , they say . daca beneficiaries should not be happy . nancy pelosi truly doesn’t care about them . republicans stand ready to make a deal!
unemployment claims are at the lowest level since 1973. much of this has to do with the massive cutting of unnecessary and job killing regulations!
democrat judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great state of pennsylvania . @foxnews . this is very unfair to republicans and to our country as a whole . must be appealed to the united states supreme court asap!
armed educators and trusted people who work within a school love our students and will protect them . very smart people . must be firearms adept & have annual training . should get yearly bonus . shootings will not happen again - a big & very inexpensive deterrent . up to states.
so true wayne , and lowest black unemployment in history !
thank you to the great men and women of the united states @secretservice for a job well done!
today , @flotus melania and i were honored to welcome prime minister @turnbullmalcolm and mrs . turnbull of australia to the @whitehouse ! 🇺🇸🇦🇺press conference:
our nation’s motto is in god we trust . this week , our nation lost an incredible leader who devoted his life to helping us understand what those words really mean . we will never forget the historic crowds , the voice , the energy , and the profound faith of billy graham ! #cpac2018
we salute our great american flag , we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance , and we all proudly stand for the national anthem . #cpac2018
after years of rebuilding other nations , we are finally rebuilding our nation - and we are restoring our confidence and our pride ! #cpac2018
for those of you who are still interested , the democrats have totally forgotten about daca . not a lot of interest on this subject from them!
my daughter , ivanka , just arrived in south korea . we cannot have a better , or smarter , person representing our country.
cpac today!
ms-13 gang members are being removed by our great ice and border patrol agents by the thousands , but these killers come back in from el salvador , and through mexico , like water . el salvador just takes our money , and mexico must help more with this problem . we need the wall!
school shooting survivor says he quit @cnn town hall after refusing scripted question . @tuckercarlson . just like so much of cnn , fake news . that’s why their ratings are so bad ! msnbc may be worse.
today , it was my great honor to host a school safety roundtable at the @whitehouse with state and local leaders , law enforcement officers , and education officials . there is nothing more important than protecting our children . they deserve to be safe , and we will deliver !
on behalf of an entire nation , congratulations to the u . s. womens hockey team on winning the gold ! #goteamusa #olympics
will be meeting with lawmakers today at 11:30 a.m. to discuss school safety . next week it will be with our nation’s governors . it’s been many years of all talk , no action . we’ll get it done!
what many people don’t understand , or don’t want to understand , is that wayne , chris and the folks who work so hard at the @nra are great people and great american patriots . they love our country and will do the right thing . make america great again!
i will be strongly pushing comprehensive background checks with an emphasis on mental health . raise age to 21 and end sale of bump stocks ! congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - i hope!
if a potential sicko shooter knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers and others who will be instantly shooting , the sicko will never attack that school . cowards won’t go there . problem solved . must be offensive , defense alone won’t work!
history shows that a school shooting lasts , on average , 3 minutes . it takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime . highly trained , gun adept , teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly , before police arrive . great deterrent!
immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions . highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this . far more assets at much less cost than guards . a gun free school is a magnet for bad people . attacks would end!
i never said give teachers guns like was stated on fake news @cnn & @nbc . what i said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best . 20% of teachers , a lot , would now be able to
i will always remember the time i spent today with courageous students , teachers and families . so much love in the midst of so much pain . we must not let them down . we must keep our children safe ! ! full listening session:
@flotus melania and i join millions of people around the world in mourning the passing of billy graham . our prayers are with his children , grandchildren , great-grandchildren and all who worked closely with reverend graham in his lifelong ministry .
yesterday , it was my great honor to recognize extraordinary law enforcement officers and first responders , and to award them the the highest possible decoration for bravery by public safety officers , the medal of valor . #americanheroes
question: if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration , right up to january 20th , why aren’t they the subject of the investigation ? why didn’t obama do something about the meddling ? why aren’t dem crimes under investigation ? ask jeff sessions!
the great billy graham is dead . there was nobody like him ! he will be missed by christians and all religions . a very special man.
question: if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration , right up to january 20th , why aren’t they the subject of the investigation ? why didn’t obama do something about the meddling ? why aren’t dem crimes under investigation ? ask jeff session!
@cnn @msnbc whether we are republican or democrat , we must now focus on strengthening background checks!
so true , thank you !
bad ratings @cnn & @msnbc got scammed when they covered the anti-trump russia rally wall-to-wall . they probably knew it was fake news but , because it was a rally against me , they pushed it hard anyway . two really dishonest newscasters , but the public is wise!
main street is booming thanks to our incredible tax cut and reform law . this shows small-business owners are more than just optimistic , they are ready to grow their businesses .
cameras running . another false accusation . why doesn’t @washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me ? one had her home mortgage paid off . only @foxnews so reported . doesn’t fit the mainstream media narrative.
a woman i don’t know and , to the best of my knowledge , never met , is on the front page of the fake news washington post saying i kissed her for two minutes yet in the lobby of trump tower 12 years ago . never happened ! who would do this in a public space with live security.
i have been much tougher on russia than obama , just look at the facts . total fake news!
hope republicans in the great state of pennsylvania challenge the new pushed congressional map , all the way to the supreme court , if necessary . your original was correct ! don’t let the dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes & waste money!
matt schlapp and cpac are getting ready for another exciting event . big difference from those days when president obama held the white house . you’ve come a long way matt!
republicans are now leading the generic poll , perhaps because of the popular tax cuts which the dems want to take away . actually , they want to raise you taxes , substantially . also , they want to do nothing on daca , r’s want to fix!
the president obama quote just before election . that’s because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to rock the boat . when i easily won the electoral college , the whole game changed and the russian excuse became the narrative of the dems.
there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig america’s elections , there’s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time , and so i’d invite mr . trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes . .
thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the obama administration had against russia , including crimea , syria and so much more . we are now starting to win again!
the faith of donald trump , a book just out by david brody and scott lamb , is a very interesting read . enjoy!
the u . s. economy is looking very good , in my opinion , even better than anticipated . companies are pouring back into our country , reversing the long term trend of leaving . the unemployment numbers are looking great , and regulations & taxes have been massively cut ! jobs , jobs , jobs
@mittromney has announced he is running for the senate from the wonderful state of utah . he will make a great senator and worthy successor to @orrinhatch , and has my full support and endorsement!
obama was president up to , and beyond , the 2016 election . so why didn’t he do something about russian meddling?
have a great , but very reflective , president’s day!
just watched a very insecure oprah winfrey , who at one point i knew very well , interview a panel of people on 60 minutes . the questions were biased and slanted , the facts incorrect . hope oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!
my great friends from nascar are having their big race today , the daytona 500. brian france and the france family are special people . enjoy the race!
thank you to kenstarr , former independent counsel , whitewater , for your insight and powerful words on fisa abuse , russian meddling etc . really great interview with @mariabartiromo
great pollster john mclaughlin now has the gop up in the generic congressional ballot . big gain over last 4 weeks . i guess people are loving the big tax cuts given them by the republicans , the cuts the dems want to take away . we need more republicans!
the fake news of big ratings loser cnn .
if it was the goal of russia to create discord , disruption and chaos within the u . s. then , with all of the committee hearings , investigations and party hatred , they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams . they are laughing their asses off in moscow . get smart america!
now that adam schiff is starting to blame president obama for russian meddling in the election , he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the democrats , lead by their fearless leader , crooked hillary clinton , lost the 2016 election . but wasn’t i a great candidate?
i never said russia did not meddle in the election , i said it may be russia , or china or another country or group , or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer . the russian hoax was that the trump campaign colluded with russia - it never did!
finally , liddle’ adam schiff , the leakin’ monster of no control , is now blaming the obama administration for russian meddling in the 2016 election . he is finally right about something . obama was president , knew of the threat , and did nothing . thank you adam!
never gotten over the fact that obama was able to send $1.7 billion dollars in cash to iran and nobody in congress , the fbi or justice called for an investigation!
general mcmaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the russians and that the only collusion was between russia and crooked h , the dnc and the dems . remember the dirty dossier , uranium , speeches , emails and the podesta company!
very sad that the fbi missed all of the many signals sent out by the florida school shooter . this is not acceptable . they are spending too much time trying to prove russian collusion with the trump campaign - there is no collusion . get back to the basics and make us all proud!
just like they don’t want to solve the daca problem , why didn’t the democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the house & senate during the obama administration . because they didn’t want to , and now they just talk!
i have seen all of the russian ads and i can say very definitively that swaying the election was *not* the main goal . rob goldman vice president of facebook ads
the fake news media never fails . hard to ignore this fact from the vice president of facebook ads , rob goldman !
funny how the fake news media doesn’t want to say that the russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for president . maybe they knew i was going to run even though i didn’t know!
deputy a . g. rod rosenstein stated at the news conference: there is no allegation in the indictment that any american was a knowing participant in this illegal activity . there is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.
charges deal don a big win , written by michael goodwin of the @nypost , succinctly states that the russians had no impact on the election results . there was no collusion with the trump campaign . she lost the old-fashioned way , by being a terrible candidate . case closed.
melania and i met such incredible people last night in broward county , florida . will never forget them , or the evening!
our entire nation , w/one heavy heart , continues to pray for the victims & their families in parkland , fl . to teachers , law enforcement , first responders & medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger: we thank you for your courage !
russia started their anti-us campaign in 2014, long before i announced that i would run for president . the results of the election were not impacted . the trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!
cannot believe how badly daca recipients have been treated by the democrats . totally abandoned ! republicans are still working hard.
i will be leaving for florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered . am also working with congress on many fronts.
presidential proclamation honoring the victims of the tragedy in parkland , florida:
lottery , continues deadly catch-and-release , and bars enforcement even for future illegal immigrants . voting for this amendment would be a vote against law enforcement , and a vote for open borders . if dems are actually serious about daca , they should support the grassley bill!
the schumer-rounds-collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe . @dhsgov says it would be the end of immigration enforcement in america . it creates a giant amnesty including for dangerous criminals , doesn’t build the wall , expands chain migration , keeps the visa.
in times of tragedy , the bonds that sustain us are those of family , faith , community , and country . these bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need .
while the republicans and democrats in congress are working hard to come up with a solution to daca , they should be strongly considering a system of merit based immigration so that we will have the people ready , willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the usa!
so many signs that the florida shooter was mentally disturbed , even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior . neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem . must always report such instances to authorities , again and again!
just spoke to governor rick scott . we are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible florida school shooting.
my prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible florida shooting . no child , teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an american school.
today , i was honored to be joined by republicans and democrats from both the house and senate , as well as members of my cabinet - to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore america’s depleted infrastructure .
as we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of african-americans to our nation , our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all . proclamation:
negotiations on daca have begun . republicans want to make a deal and democrats say they want to make a deal . wouldn’t it be great if we could finally , after so many years , solve the daca puzzle . this will be our last chance , there will never be another opportunity ! march 5th.
our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except , of course , the democrats . after many years we have taken care of our military , now we have to fix our roads , bridges , tunnels , airports and more . bipartisan , make deal dems?
the journey to #maga began @cpac 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something i look forward to every year . see you at #cpac2018!
thank you to sue kruczek , who lost her wonderful and talented son nick to the opioid scourge , for your kind words while on @foxandfriends . we are fighting this terrible epidemic hard - nick will not have died in vain!
this will be a big week for infrastructure . after so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the middle east , it is now time to start investing in our country!
just spoke to @johnkasich to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from @westervillepd . this is a true tragedy!
rep . lou barletta , a great republican from pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters , will make a fantastic senator . he is strong & smart , loves pennsylvania & loves our country ! voted for tax cuts , unlike bob casey , who listened to tax hikers pelosi and schumer!
4.2 million hard working americans have already received a large bonus and/or pay increase because of our recently passed tax cut & jobs bill . and it will only get better ! we are far ahead of schedule.
so many positive things going on for the u . s.a . and the fake news media just doesn’t want to go there . same negative stories over and over again ! no wonder the people no longer trust the media , whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history ! #maga
my administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe , modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border , ending chain migration , and canceling the visa lottery . congress must secure the immigration system and protect americans .
my thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers , their families , and everybody at the @westervillepd .
republicans want to fix daca far more than the democrats do . the dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011, and they decided not to do anything about daca . they only want to use it as a campaign issue . vote republican!
agencies , not just the fbi & doj , now the state department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the election . comey had conversations with donald trump , which i don’t believe were accurate . he leaked information corrupt . tom fitton of judicial watch on @foxnews
my view is that not only has trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the dossier and the lies about the clinton/dnc dossier , it shows that he’s been victimized . he’s been victimized by the obama administration who were using all sorts of.
peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation . some are true and some are false . some are old and some are new . there is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone . is there no such thing any longer as due process?
according to the @nytimes , a russian sold phony secrets on trump to the u . s. asking price was $10 million , brought down to $1 million to be paid over time . i hope people are now seeing & understanding what is going on here . it is all now starting to come out - drain the swamp!
the democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew , because of sources and methods and more , would have to be heavily redacted , whereupon they would blame the white house for lack of transparency . told them to re-do and send back in proper form!
jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low!
costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more republicans in the 2018 election , and beyond . this bill is a big victory for our military , but much waste in order to get dem votes . fortunately , daca not included in this bill , negotiations to start now!
without more republicans in congress , we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally , after many years of depletion , take care of our military . sadly , we needed some dem votes for passage . must elect more republicans in 2018 election!
just signed bill . our military will now be stronger than ever before . we love and need our military and gave them everything — and more . first time this has happened in a long time . also means jobs , jobs , jobs!
wow ! -senator mark warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a russian oligarch . warner did not want a paper trail on a private meeting in london he requested with steele of fraudulent dossier fame . all tied into crooked hillary.
time to end the visa lottery . congress must secure the immigration system and protect americans .
as long as we open our eyes to god’s grace - and open our hearts to god’s love - then america will forever be the land of the free , the home of the brave , and a light unto all nations . #nationalprayerbreakfast
i will be meeting with henry kissinger at 1:45pm . will be discussing north korea , china and the middle east.
our founders invoked our creator four times in the declaration of independence . our currency declares in god we trust . and we place our hands on our hearts as we recite the pledge of allegiance and proclaim that we are one nation under god . #nationalprayerbreakfast
will be heading over shortly to make remarks at the national prayer breakfast in washington . great religious and political leaders , and many friends , including t . v. producer mark burnett of our wonderful 14 season apprentice triumph , will be there . looking forward to seeing all!
the budget agreement today is so important for our great military . it ends the dangerous sequester and gives secretary mattis what he needs to keep america great . republicans and democrats must support our troops and support this bill!
congratulations to the republic of korea on what will be a magnificent winter olympics ! what the south korean people have built is truly an inspiration !
best wishes to the republic of korea on hosting the @olympics ! what a wonderful opportunity to show everyone that you are a truly great nation !
new fbi texts are bombshells!
in the old days , when good news was reported , the stock market would go up . today , when good news is reported , the stock market goes down . big mistake , and we have so much good great news about the economy!
congratulations @elonmusk and @spacex on the successful #falconheavy launch . this achievement , along with @nasa’s commercial and international partners , continues to show american ingenuity at its best !
happy birthday to our 40th president of the united states of america , ronald reagan !
today , we heard the experiences of law enforcement professionals and community leaders working to combat the threat of ms-13, and the reforms we need from congress to defeat it . watch here:
we need a 21st century merit-based immigration system . chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security .
polling shows nearly 7 in 10 americans support an immigration reform package that includes daca , fully secures the border , ends chain migration & cancels the visa lottery . if d’s oppose this deal , they aren’t serious about daca-they just want open borders .
my prayers and best wishes are with the family of edwin jackson , a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken . @colts
so disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @colts linebacker edwin jackson . this is just one of many such preventable tragedies . we must get the dems to get tough on the border , and with illegal immigration , fast!
thanks to the historic tax cuts that i signed into law , your paychecks are going way up , your taxes are going way down , and america is once again open for business !
representative devin nunes , a man of tremendous courage and grit , may someday be recognized as a great american hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure!
any deal on daca that does not include strong border security and the desperately needed wall is a total waste of time . march 5th is rapidly approaching and the dems seem not to care about daca . make a deal!
little adam schiff , who is desperate to run for higher office , is one of the biggest liars and leakers in washington , right up there with comey , warner , brennan and clapper ! adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information . must be stopped!
thank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth . perhaps that’s why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition!
the democrats are pushing for universal healthcare while thousands of people are marching in the uk because their u system is going broke and not working . dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care . no thanks!
congratulations to the philadelphia eagles on a great super bowl victory!
my thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in south carolina . thank you to our incredible first responders for the work they’ve done!
a tool of anti-trump political actors . this is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the fbi to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law . the fbi wasn’t straight with congress , as it hid most of these facts from investigators . wall street journal
the four page memo released friday reports the disturbing fact about how the fbi and fisa appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath . the fbi failed to inform the fisa court that the clinton campaign had funded the dossier . the fbi became.
great jobs numbers and finally , after many years , rising wages- and nobody even talks about them . only russia , russia , russia , despite the fact that , after a year of looking , there is no collusion!
this memo totally vindicates trump in probe . but the russian witch hunt goes on and on . their was no collusion and there was no obstruction the word now used because , after one year of looking endlessly and finding nothing , collusion is dead . this is an american disgrace!
rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49% , a far better number than i had in winning the election , and higher than certain sacred cows . other trump polls are way up also . so why does the media refuse to write this ? oh well , someday!
today , it was my honor to join the great men and women of @dhsgov , @customsborder , @icegov and @uscis at the u . s. customs and border protection national targeting center in sterling , virginia . fact sheet:
trump the orator outlines the greatness of america to democrats’ disgust
with 3.5 million americans receiving bonuses or other benefits from their employers as a result of tax cuts , 2018 is off to great start ! ✅unemployment rate at 4.1% . ✅average earnings up 2.9% in the last year . ✅200,000 new american jobs . ✅#maga🇺🇸
you had hillary clinton and the democratic party try to hide the fact that they gave money to gps fusion to create a dossier which was used by their allies in the obama administration to convince a court misleadingly , by all accounts , to spy on the trump team . tom fitton , jw
the top leadership and investigators of the fbi and the justice department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of democrats and against republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago . rank & file are great people!
the democrats just aren’t calling about daca . nancy pelosi and chuck schumer have to get moving fast , or they’ll disappoint you again . we have a great chance to make a deal or , blame the dems ! march 5th is coming up fast.
thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the state of the union speech . 45.6 million people watched , the highest number in history . @foxnews beat every other network , for the first time ever , with 11.7 million people tuning in . delivered from the heart!
march 5th is rapidly approaching and the democrats are doing nothing about daca . they resist , blame , complain and obstruct - and do nothing . start pushing nancy pelosi and the dems to work out a daca fix , now!
heading to beautiful west virginia to be with great members of the republican party . will be planning infrastructure and discussing immigration and daca , not easy when we have no support from the democrats . not one dem voted for our tax cut bill ! need more republicans in ‘18.

congratulations to america’s new secretary of @hhsgov , alex azar !
our economy is better than it has been in many decades . businesses are coming back to america like never before . chrysler , as an example , is leaving mexico and coming back to the usa . unemployment is nearing record lows . we are on the right track!
somebody please inform jay-z that because of my policies , black unemployment has just been reported to be at the lowest rate ever recorded!
democrats are not interested in border safety & security or in the funding and rebuilding of our military . they are only interested in obstruction!
i have offered daca a wonderful deal , including a doubling in the number of recipients & a twelve year pathway to citizenship , for two reasons: 1 because the republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem . 2 to show that democrats do not want to solve daca , only use it!
taliban targeted innocent afghans , brave police in kabul today . our thoughts and prayers go to the victims , and first responders . we will not allow the taliban to win!
on holocaust remembrance day we mourn and grieve the murder of 6 million innocent jewish men , women and children , and the millions of others who perished in the evil nazi genocide . we pledge with all of our might and resolve: never again !
thank you to brandon judd of the national border patrol council for his strong statement on @foxandfriends that we very badly need the wall . must also end loophole of catch & release and clean up the legal and other procedures at the border now for safety & security reasons.
thank you for the wonderful welcome @wef ! #davos2018
daca has been made increasingly difficult by the fact that cryin’ chuck schumer took such a beating over the shutdown that he is unable to act on immigration!

earlier today , i spoke with @govmattbevin of kentucky regarding yesterday’s shooting at marshall county high school . my thoughts and prayers are with bailey holt , preston cope , their families , and all of the wounded victims who are in recovery . we are with you!
tremendous investment by companies from all over the world being made in america . there has never been anything like it . now disney , j . p. morgan chase and many others . massive regulation reduction and tax cuts are making us a powerhouse again . long way to go ! jobs , jobs , jobs!
cryin’ chuck schumer fully understands , especially after his humiliating defeat , that if there is no wall , there is no daca . we must have safety and security , together with a strong military , for our great people!
where are the 50,000 important text messages between fbi lovers lisa page and peter strzok ? blaming samsung!
thank you to general john kelly , who is doing a fantastic job , and all of the staff and others in the white house , for a job well done . long hours and fake reporting makes your job more difficult , but it is always great to win , and few have won more than us!
nobody knows for sure that the republicans & democrats will be able to reach a deal on daca by february 8, but everyone will be trying . with a big additional focus put on military strength and border security . the dems have just learned that a shutdown is not the answer!
in one of the biggest stories in a long time , the fbi now says it is missing five months worth of lovers strzok-page texts , perhaps 50,000, and all in prime time . wow!
in one of the biggest stories in a long time , the fbi says it is now missing five months worth of lovers strzok - page texts , perhaps 50,000, all in prime time . wow!
even crazy jim acosta of fake news cnn agrees: trump world and wh sources dancing in end zone: trump wins again . schumer and dems caved . gambled and lost . thank you for your honesty jim!
big win for republicans as democrats cave on shutdown . now i want a big win for everyone , including republicans , democrats and daca , but especially for our great military and border security . should be able to get there . see you at the negotiating table!
end the democrats obstruction !
democrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base . they don’t want to do it but are powerless!
the democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens . not good!
thank you to brad blakeman on @foxnews for grading year one of my presidency with an a-and likewise to doug schoen for the very good grade and statements . working hard!
great to see how hard republicans are fighting for our military and safety at the border . the dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked . if stalemate continues , republicans should go to 51% nuclear option and vote on real , long term budget , no c . r.’s!
eric trump on @judgejeanine on @foxnews now!
the trump administration has terminated more unnecessary regulation , in just twelve months , than any other administration has terminated during their full term in office , no matter what the length . the good news is , there is much more to come!
unprecedented success for our country , in so many ways , since the election . record stock market , strong on military , crime , borders , & isis , judicial strength & numbers , lowest unemployment for women & all , massive tax cuts , end of individual mandate - and so much more . big 2018!
beautiful weather all over our great country , a perfect day for all women to march . get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months . lowest female unemployment in 18 years!
democrats are holding our military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration . can’t let that happen!
#america first!
for those asking , the republicans only have 51 votes in the senate , and they need 60. that is why we need to win more republicans in 2018 election ! we can then be even tougher on crime and border , and even better to our military & veterans!
this is the one year anniversary of my presidency and the democrats wanted to give me a nice present . #democratshutdown
democrats are far more concerned with illegal immigrants than they are with our great military or safety at our dangerous southern border . they could have easily made a deal but decided to play shutdown politics instead . #weneedmorerepublicansin18 in order to power through mess!
not looking good for our great military or safety & security on the very dangerous southern border . dems want a shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the tax cuts , and what they are doing for our booming economy.
excellent preliminary meeting in oval with @senschumer - working on solutions for security and our great military together with @senatemajldr mcconnell and @speakerryan . making progress - four week extension would be best!
just signed 702 bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection . this is not the same fisa law that was so wrongly abused during the election . i will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the american people first!
today , i was honored and proud to address the 45th annual @march_for_life ! you are living witnesses of this year’s march for life theme: #lovesaveslives .
shutting down the government is a very serious thing . people die , accidents happen . i don’t know how i would vote right now on a cr , ok ? sen . dianne feinstein d-calif
@whitehouse briefing with director marc short and director mick mulvaney .
government funding bill past last night in the house of representatives . now democrats are needed if it is to pass in the senate - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders . shutdown coming ? we need more republican victories in 2018!
house of representatives needs to pass government funding bill tonight . so important for our country - our military needs it!
america will once again be a nation that thinks big , dreams bigger , and always reaches for the stars . you are the ones who will shape america’s destiny . you are the ones who will restore our prosperity . and you are the ones who are making america great again ! #maga
departing pittsburgh now , where it was my great honor to stand with our incredible workers , and to show the world that america is back - and we are coming back bigger and better and stronger than ever before !
a government shutdown will be devastating to our military . something the dems care very little about!
chip should be part of a long term solution , not a 30 day , or short term , extension!
we need the wall for the safety and security of our country . we need the wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from mexico , now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world . if there is no wall , there is no deal!
will be going to pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to rick saccone , running for congress in a special election march 13. rick is a great guy . we need more republicans to continue our already successful agenda!
the wall will be paid for , directly or indirectly , or through longer term reimbursement , by mexico , which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the u . s. the $20 billion dollar wall is peanuts compared to what mexico makes from the u . s. nafta is a bad joke!
the wall is the wall , it has never changed or evolved from the first day i conceived of it . parts will be , of necessity , see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains , wastelands or tough rivers or water.
isis is in retreat , our economy is booming , investments and jobs are pouring back into the country , and so much more ! together there is nothing we can’t overcome-even a very biased media . we are making america great again!
despite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage , there are many great reporters i respect and lots of good news for the american people to be proud of!
and the fake news winners are .
main street is back ! strongest holiday sales bump since the great recession - beating forecasts by billions of dollars .
during the campaign , i promised to make america great again by bringing businesses and jobs back to our country . i am very proud to see companies like chrysler moving operations from mexico to michigan where there are so many great american workers !
i promised that my policies would allow companies like apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the united states . great to see apple follow through as a result of tax cuts . huge win for american workers and the usa !
today , we witnessed an incredible moment in history – the presentation of congress’ highest civilian honor to our friend , and true american hero , bob dole . #congressionalgoldmedal
eric trump on @foxandfriends now!
we need to keep america safe , including moving away from a random chain migration and lottery system , to one that is merit-based .
new report from doj & dhs shows that nearly 3 in 4 individuals convicted of terrorism-related charges are foreign-born . we have submitted to congress a list of resources and reforms.
today , it was my honor to welcome president nursultan nazarbayev of kazakhstan to the @whitehouse !
president donald j . trump proclaims january 16, 2018, as religious freedom day
unemployment for black americans is the lowest ever recorded . trump approval ratings with black americans has doubled . thank you , and it will get even much better ! @foxnews
90% of trump 2017 news coverage was negative -and much of it contrived ! @foxandfriends
do you notice the fake news mainstream media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news , but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative . the russian collusion hoax is dead , except as it pertains to the dems . public gets it!
the democrats want to shut down the government over amnesty for all and border security . the biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding military , at a time we need it more than ever . we need a merit based system of immigration , and we need it now ! no more dangerous lottery.
we must have security at our very dangerous southern border , and we must have a great wall to help protect us , and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!
senator dicky durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the daca meeting . deals can’t get made when there is no trust ! durbin blew daca and is hurting our military.
to stop drugs , they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do . my standard is very simple , america first & make america great again!
statement by me last night in florida: honestly , i don’t think the democrats want to make a deal . they talk about daca , but they don’t want to help . we are ready , willing and able to make a deal but they don’t want to . they don’t want security at the border , they don’t want.
big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible among many other things . president trump reversed the policies of president obama , and reversed our economic decline . thank you stuart varney . @foxandfriends
president trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy . tax cut bonuses to more than 2,000,000 workers . most explosive stock market rally that we’ve seen in modern times . 18,000 to 26,000 from election , and grounded in profitability and growth . all trump , not 0.
i , as president , want people coming into our country who are going to help us become strong and great again , people coming in through a system based on merit . no more lotteries ! #america first
daca is probably dead because the democrats don’t really want it , they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our military.
and they knew exactly what i said and meant . they just wanted a story . fake news!
the wall street journal stated falsely that i said to them i have a good relationship with kim jong un of n . korea . obviously i didn’t say that . i said i’d have a good relationship with kim jong un , a big difference . fortunately we now record conversations with reporters.
so much fake news is being reported . they don’t even try to get it right , or correct it when they are wrong . they promote the fake book of a mentally deranged author , who knowingly writes false information . the mainstream media is crazed that we won the election!
i don’t believe the democrats really want to see a deal on daca . they are all talk and no action . this is the time but , day by day , they are blowing the one great opportunity they have . too bad!
yesterday was another big day for jobs and the stock market . chrysler coming back to u . s. michigan from mexico and many more companies paying out tax cut money to employees . if dems won in november , market would have tanked ! it was headed for disaster.
america first!
the democrats are all talk and no action . they are doing nothing to fix daca . great opportunity missed . too bad!
yesterday was a big day for the stock market . jobs are coming back to america . chrysler is coming back to the usa , from mexico and many others will follow . tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing . american business is hot again!
today , it was my great honor to proclaim january 15, 2018, as martin luther king jr . , federal holiday . i encourage all americans to observe this day with appropriate civic , community , and service activities in honor of dr . kings life and legacy .
never said anything derogatory about haitians other than haiti is , obviously , a very poor and troubled country . never said take them out . made up by dems . i have a wonderful relationship with haitians . probably should record future meetings - unfortunately , no trust!
sadly , democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal , not a fair deal , for daca . take care of our military , and our country , first!
the language used by me at the daca meeting was tough , but this was not the language used . what was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for daca!
because of the democrats not being interested in life and safety , daca has now taken a big step backwards . the dems will threaten shutdown , but what they are really doing is shutting down our military , at a time we need it most . get smart , make america great again!
countries which are doing badly . i want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level . i want safety and security for our people . i want to stop the massive inflow of drugs . i want to fund our military , not do a dem defund.
the so-called bipartisan daca deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of republican senators and congressmen was a big step backwards . wall was not properly funded , chain & lottery were made worse and usa would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime.
reason i canceled my trip to london is that i am not a big fan of the obama administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in london for peanuts , only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars . bad deal . wanted me to cut ribbon-no!
the democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the southern border , risking thousands of lives in the process . it is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all americans . we must build a great wall , think merit and end lottery & chain . usa!
democrat dianne feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization . very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal . she blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first!
chrysler is moving a massive plant from mexico to michigan , reversing a years long opposite trend . thank you chrysler , a very wise decision . the voters in michigan are very happy they voted for trump/pence . plenty of more to follow!
more great news as a result of historical tax cuts and reform: fiat chrysler announces plan to invest more than $1 billion in michigan plant , relocating their heavy-truck production from mexico to michigan , adding 2,500 new jobs and paying $2,000 bonus to u . s. employees !
small business poll has highest approval numbers in the polls history . all business is just at the beginning of something really special!
thank you adam levine , the federalist , in interview on @foxandfriends donald trump is the greatest president our country has ever seen.
yesterday , i signed the #interdictact h . r. 2142 with bipartisan members of congress to help end the flow of drugs into our country . together , we are committed to doing everything we can to combat the deadly scourge of drug addiction and overdose in the united states !
great news , as a result of our tax cuts & jobs act !
with that being said , i have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today’s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land . we need it ! get smart!
45 year low in illegal immigration this year . @foxandfriends
house votes on controversial fisa act today . this is the act that may have been used , with the help of the discredited and phony dossier , to so badly surveil and abuse the trump campaign by the previous administration and others?
in new quinnipiac poll , 66% of people feel the economy is excellent or good . that is the highest number ever recorded by this poll.
disproven and paid for by democrats dossier used to spy on trump campaign . did fbi use intel tool to influence the election ? @foxandfriends did dems or clinton also pay russians ? where are hidden and smashed dnc servers ? where are crooked hillary emails ? what a mess!
good news: toyota and mazda announce giant new huntsville , alabama , plant which will produce over 300,000 cars and suv’s a year and employ 4000 people . companies are coming back to the u . s. in a very big way . congratulations alabama!
cutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes america the place to invest ! great news as toyota and mazda announce they are bringing 4,000 jobs and investing $1.6 billion in alabama , helping to further grow our economy !
the united states needs the security of the wall on the southern border , which must be part of any daca approval . the safety and security of our country is #1!
today , it was my great honor to welcome prime minister erna solberg of norway to the @whitehouse - a great friend and ally of the united states ! joint press conference:
i want to thank my @cabinet for working tirelessly on behalf of our country . 2017 was a year of monumental achievement and we look forward to the year ahead . together , we are delivering results and making america great again !
the single greatest witch hunt in american history continues . there was no collusion , everybody including the dems knows there was no collusion , & yet on and on it goes . russia & the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing . republicans should finally take control!
the fact that sneaky dianne feinstein , who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between trump/russia has not been found , would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way , totally without authorization , is a disgrace . must have tough primary!
it just shows everyone how broken and unfair our court system is when the opposing side in a case such as daca always runs to the 9th circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.
@icegov hsi agents and ero officers , on behalf of an entire nation , thank you for what you are doing 24/7/365 to keep fellow american’s safe . everyone is so grateful ! #lawenforcementappreciationday president @realdonaldtrump
thank you @gopleader kevin mccarthy ! couldn’t agree w/you more . together , we are #maga🇺🇸
as i made very clear today , our country needs the security of the wall on the southern border , which must be part of any daca approval.
today , it was my great honor to sign a new executive order to ensure veterans have the resources they need as they transition back to civilian life . we must ensure that our heroes are given the care and support they so richly deserve !
happy new year ! we are making america great again , and much faster than anyone thought possible!
as our country rapidly grows stronger and smarter , i want to wish all of my friends , supporters , enemies , haters , and even the very dishonest fake news media , a happy and healthy new year . 2018 will be a great year for america!
iran , the number one state of sponsored terror with numerous violations of human rights occurring on an hourly basis , has now closed down the internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate . not good!
what a year it’s been , and were just getting started . together , we are making america great again ! happy new year ! !
my deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in douglas county @dcsheriff , and their families . we love our police and law enforcement - god bless them all ! #lesm
why would smart voters want to put democrats in congress in 2018 election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the election . people are much better off now not to mention isis , va , judges , strong border , 2nd a , tax cuts & more?
if the dems crooked hillary got elected , your stocks would be down 50% from values on election day . now they have a great future - and just beginning !
big protests in iran . the people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism . looks like they will not take it any longer . the usa is watching very closely for human rights violations!
trump rally: stocks put 2017 in the record books
jobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the u . s. unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically cut , and it will only get better . much more to come!
i use social media not because i like to , but because it is the only way to fight a very dishonest and unfair press , now often referred to as fake news media . phony and non-existent sources are being used more often than ever . many stories & reports a pure fiction!
on taxes: this is the biggest corporate rate cut ever , going back to the corporate income tax rate of roughly 80 years ago . this is a huge pro-growth stimulus for the economy . every year the obama wh overstated how the economy would grow . now real economics and jobs . @wsj report
oppressive regimes cannot endure forever , and the day will come when the iranian people will face a choice . the world is watching !
the entire world understands that the good people of iran want change , and , other than the vast military power of the united states , that iran’s people are what their leaders fear the most .
many reports of peaceful protests by iranian citizens fed up with regime’s corruption & its squandering of the nation’s wealth to fund terrorism abroad . iranian govt should respect their people’s rights , including right to express themselves . the world is watching ! #iranprotests
the democrats have been told , and fully understand , that there can be no daca without the desperately needed wall at the southern border and an end to the horrible chain migration & ridiculous lottery system of immigration etc . we must protect our country at all cost!
why is the united states post office , which is losing many billions of dollars a year , while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages , making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer ? should be charging much more!
while the fake news loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating , @foxandfriends just showed that my rating on dec . 28, 2017, was approximately the same as president obama on dec . 28, 2009, which was 47% . and this despite massive negative trump coverage & russia hoax!
in the east , it could be the coldest new year’s eve on record . perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old global warming that our country , but not other countries , was going to pay trillions of dollars to protect against . bundle up!
together , we are making america great again !
ive been saying it for a long , long time . #noko
caught red handed - very disappointed that china is allowing oil to go into north korea . there will never be a friendly solution to the north korea problem if this continues to happen!
retail sales are at record numbers . we’ve got the economy going better than anyone ever dreamt - and you haven’t seen anything yet!
vanity fair , which looks like it is on its last legs , is bending over backwards in apologizing for the minor hit they took at crooked h . anna wintour , who was all set to be amb to court of st james’s & a big fundraiser for ch , is beside herself in grief & begging for forgiveness!
arrests of ms-13 members , associates up 83% under trump
on 1/20 - the day trump was inaugurated - an estimated 35,000 isis fighters held approx 17,500 square miles of territory in both iraq and syria . as of 12/21, the u . s. military est the remaining 1,000 or so fighters occupy roughly 1,900 square miles . @jamiejmcintyre @dcexaminer
just left west palm beach fire & rescue #2. met with great men and women as representatives of those who do so much for all of us . firefighters , paramedics , first responders - what amazing people they are!

all signs are that business is looking really good for next year , only to be helped further by our tax cut bill . will be a great year for companies and jobs ! stock market is poised for another year of success!
wow , @foxandfrlends dossier is bogus . clinton campaign , dnc funded dossier . fbi cannot after all of this time verify claims in dossier of russia/trump collusion . fbi tainted . and they used this crooked hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the trump campaign!
based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular individual mandate has been terminated as part of our tax cut bill , which essentially repeals over time obamacare , the democrats & republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new healthcare plan!
i hope everyone is having a great christmas , then tomorrow it’s back to work in order to make america great again which is happening faster than anyone anticipated!
merry christmas ! !!
merry christmas ! !
people are proud to be saying merry christmas again . i am proud to have led the charge against the assault of our cherished and beautiful phrase . merry christmas ! !! ! !
the tax cut/reform bill , including massive alaska drilling and the repeal of the highly unpopular individual mandate , brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had . don’t let the fake news convince you otherwise . and our insider polls are strong!
the fake news refuses to talk about how big and how strong our base is . they show fake polls just like they report fake news . despite only negative reporting , we are doing well - nobody is going to beat us . make america great again!
@foxnews-fbi’s andrew mccabe , in addition to his wife getting all of this money from m clinton puppet , he was using , allegedly , his fbi official email account to promote her campaign . you obviously cannot do this . these were the people who were investigating hillary clinton.
remember , the republicans are 5-0 in congressional races this year . in senate , i said roy m would lose in alabama and supported big luther strange - and roy lost . virginia candidate was not a trumper , and he lost . good republican candidates will win big!
the stock market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low . so many things accomplished by the trump administration , perhaps more than any other president in first year . sadly , will never be reported correctly by the fake news media!
wow , fbi lawyer james baker reassigned , according to @foxnews.
fbi deputy director andrew mccabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits . 90 days to go ? !!!
how can fbi deputy director andrew mccabe , the man in charge , along with leakin’ james comey , of the phony hillary clinton investigation including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails be given $700,000 for wife’s campaign by clinton puppets during investigation?
remember , the most hated part of obamacare is the individual mandate , which is being terminated under our just signed tax cut bill.
today , it was my great honor to sign the largest tax cuts and reform in the history of our country . full remarks:
the united nations security council just voted 15-0 in favor of additional sanctions on north korea . the world wants peace , not death!
congressman ron desantis is a brilliant young leader , yale and then harvard law , who would make a great governor of florida . he loves our country and is a true fighter!
95% of americans will pay less or , at worst , the same amount of taxes mostly far less . the dems only want to raise your taxes!
will be signing the biggest ever tax cut and reform bill in 30 minutes in oval office . will also be signing a much needed 4 billion dollar missile defense bill.
with all my administration has done on legislative approvals broke harry truman’s record , regulation cutting , judicial appointments , building military , va , tax cuts & reform , record economy/stock market and so much more , i am sure great credit will be given by mainstream news?
the president has accomplished some absolutely historic things during this past year . thank you charlie kirk of turning points usa . sadly , the fake mainstream media will never talk about our accomplishments in their end of year reviews . we are compiling a long & beautiful list.
at some point , and for the good of the country , i predict we will start working with the democrats in a bipartisan fashion . infrastructure would be a perfect place to start . after having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the middle east , it is time to start rebuilding our country!
so true !
our big and very popular tax cut and reform bill has taken on an unexpected new source of love - that is big companies and corporations showering their workers with bonuses . this is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of , and now it is the rage . merry christmas!
thank you to everyone who joined me at the @whitehouse yesterday . together , we are making america great again !
house democrats want a shutdown for the holidays in order to distract from the very popular , just passed , tax cuts . house republicans , don’t let this happen . pass the c . r. today and keep our government open!
home sales hit best numbers in 10 years ! make america great again
was @foxandfriends just named the most influential show in news ? you deserve it - three great people ! the many fake news hate shows should study your formula for success!
the massive tax cuts , which the fake news media is desperate to write badly about so as to please their democrat bosses , will soon be kicking in and will speak for themselves . companies are already making big payments to workers . dems want to raise taxes , hate these big cuts!
we are making america great again !
we are delivering historic tax relief for the american people ! #taxcutsandjobsact
together , we are making america great again !
i would like to congratulate @senatemajldr on having done a fantastic job both strategically & politically on the passing in the senate of the massive tax cut & reform bill . i could have not asked for a better or more talented partner . our team will go onto many more victories!
the tax cuts are so large and so meaningful , and yet the fake news is working overtime to follow the lead of their friends , the defeated dems , and only demean . this is truly a case where the results will speak for themselves , starting very soon . jobs , jobs , jobs!
the united states senate just passed the biggest in history tax cut and reform bill . terrible individual mandate obamacarerepealed . goes to the house tomorrow morning for final vote . if approved , there will be a news conference at the white house at approximately 1:00 p.m.
congratulations to paul ryan , kevin mccarthy , kevin brady , steve scalise , cathy mcmorris rodgers and all great house republicans who voted in favor of cutting your taxes!
a story in the @washingtonpost that i was close to rescinding the nomination of justice gorsuch prior to confirmation is fake news . i never even wavered and am very proud of him and the job he is doing as a justice of the u . s. supreme court . the unnamed sources don’t exist!
stocks and the economy have a long way to go after the tax cut bill is totally understood and appreciated in scope and size . immediate expensing will have a big impact . biggest tax cuts and reform ever passed . enjoy , and create many beautiful jobs!
dow rises 5000 points on the year for the first time ever - make america great again!
together , our task is to strengthen our families , to build up our communities , to serve our citizens , and to celebrate american greatness as a shining example to the world .
with the strategy that i announced today , we are declaring that america is in the game and america is determined to win ! our four pillars of national security strategy:
70 record closes for the dow so far this year ! we have never had 70 dow records in a one year period . wow!
thank you maria b !
so true ivanka !
as the world watches , we are days away from passing historic tax cuts for american families and businesses . it will be the biggest tax cut and tax reform in the history of our country !
when the american people speak , all of us should listen . just over one year ago , you spoke loud and clear . on november 8, 2016, you voted to make america great again !
over the past 11 months , i have travelled tens of thousands of miles , to visit 13 countries . i have met with more than 100 world leaders and everywhere i traveled , it was my highest privilege and greatest honor to represent the american people !
our deepest sympathies and most heartfelt prayers are with the victims of the train derailment in washington state . we are closely monitoring the situation and coordinating with local authorities .
my thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved in the train accident in dupont , washington . thank you to all of our wonderful first responders who are on the scene . we are currently monitoring here at the white house.
the train accident that just occurred in dupont , wa shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly . seven trillion dollars spent in the middle east while our roads , bridges , tunnels , railways and more crumble ! not for long!
ivanka trump will be interviewed on @foxandfriends.
remember , republicans are 5-0 in congressional races this year . the media refuses to mention this . i said gillespie and moore would lose for very different reasons , and they did . i also predicted i would win . republicans will do well in 2018, very well ! @foxandfriends
more than a century after conquering flight , the #wrightbrothers continue to motivate & inspire americans , who never tire of exploration & innovation . this great american spirit can be found in the design of every new supersonic jet and next generation:
wonderful weekend at camp david . a very special place . a lot of very important work done . heading back to the @whitehouse now .
as a candidate , i promised we would pass a massive tax cut for the everyday working american families who are the backbone and the heartbeat of our country . now , we are just days away .
weekly address🇺🇸
tax cuts will increase investment in the american economy and in u . s. workers , leading to higher growth , higher wages , and more jobs !
congratulations to two great and hardworking guys , corey lewandowski and david bossie , on the success of their just out book , let trump be trump . finally people with real knowledge are writing about our wonderful and exciting campaign!
great job kevin , we are all proud of you !
dow , s&p 500 and nasdaq close at record highs ! #maga
today , it was my tremendous honor to visit marine helicopter squadron one hmx-1 at the marine corps air facility in quantico , virginia . i am honored to serve as your commander-in-chief . on behalf of an entire nation , thank you for your sacrifice and service . we love you !
you are always there for us – the men and women in blue . thank you to our police , thank you to our sheriffs , and thank you to our law enforcement families . god bless you all , and god bless america ! #lesm
to each member of the graduating class from the national academy at quantico , congratulations !
it was my honor . thank you !
manufacturing optimism rose to another all-time high in the latest @shopfloornam outlook survey
in 1960, there were approximately 20,000 pages in the code of federal regulations . today there are over 185,000 pages , as seen in the roosevelt room . today , we cut the red tape ! it is time to set free our dreams and make america great again !
when americans are free to thrive , innovate , & prosper , there is no challenge too great , no task too large , & no goal beyond our reach . we are a nation of explorers , pioneers , innovators & inventors . we are nation of people who work hard , dream big , & who never , ever give up .
today , we gathered in the roosevelt room for one single reason: to cut the red tape ! for many decades , an ever-growing maze of regs , rules , and restrictions has cost our country trillions of dollars , millions of jobs , countless american factories , & devastated entire industries .
as a candidate , i promised we would pass a massive tax cut for the everyday , working americans . if you make your voices heard , this moment will be forever remembered as a great new beginning – the dawn of a brilliant american future shining with patriotism , prosperity and pride !
republican tax cuts are looking very good . all are working hard . in the meantime , the stock market hit another record high!
thank you omarosa for your service ! i wish you continued success.
if last night’s election proved anything , it proved that we need to put up great republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the house and senate.
wow , more than 90% of fake news media coverage of me is negative , with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories . hence my use of social media , the only way to get the truth out . much of mainstream meadia has become a joke ! @foxandfriends
the reason i originally endorsed luther strange and his numbers went up mightily , is that i said roy moore will not be able to win the general election . i was right ! roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!
congratulations to doug jones on a hard fought victory . the write-in votes played a very big factor , but a win is a win . the people of alabama are great , and the republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time . it never ends!
wishing all of those celebrating #hanukkah around the world a happy and healthy eight nights in the company of those they love .
consumer confidence is at an all-time high , along with a record high stock market . unemployment is at a 17 year low . make america great again ! working to pass massive tax cuts looking good.
the people of alabama will do the right thing . doug jones is pro-abortion , weak on crime , military and illegal immigration , bad for gun owners and veterans and against the wall . jones is a pelosi/schumer puppet . roy moore will always vote with us . vote roy moore!
lightweight senator kirsten gillibrand , a total flunky for chuck schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago and would do anything for them , is now in the ring fighting against trump . very disloyal to bill & crooked-used!
despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent , the democrats have been unable to show any collusion with russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who i don’t know and/or have never met . fake news!
another false story , this time in the failing @nytimes , that i watch 4-8 hours of television a day - wrong ! also , i seldom , if ever , watch cnn or msnbc , both of which i consider fake news . i never watch don lemon , who i once called the dumbest man on television ! bad reporting.
very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the fake news media . they are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them . major lies written , then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed . a stain on america!
getting closer and closer on the tax cut bill . shaping up even better than projected . house and senate working very hard and smart . end result will be not only important , but special!
things are going really well for our economy , a subject the fake news spends as little time as possible discussing ! stock market hit another record high , unemployment is now at a 17 year low and companies are coming back into the usa . really good news , and much more to come!
no american should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country . our cities should be sanctuaries for americans – not for criminal aliens !
great army - navy game . army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the commander-in-chief’s trophy ! congratulations!
great army - navy game . army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the commander-in-chief’s trophy last time was 1996. wow ! congratulations!
@daveweigel of the washington post just admitted that his picture was a fake fraud ? showing an almost empty arena last night for my speech in pensacola when , in fact , he knew the arena was packed as shown also on t . v. fake news , he should be fired.
@daveweigel @washingtonpost put out a phony photo of an empty arena hours before i arrived @ the venue , w/ thousands of people outside , on their way in . real photos now shown as i spoke . packed house , many people unable to get in . demand apology & retraction from fake news wapo !
have a great game today , @usarmy and @usnavy - i will be watching . we love our u . s. military . on behalf of an entire nation , thank you for your sacrifice and service ! #armynavygame #usa🇺🇸
it was my great honor to celebrate the opening of two extraordinary museums-the mississippi state history museum & the mississippi civil rights museum . we pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past & dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom , equality , justice & peace .
heading to the great state of mississippi at the invitation of their popular and respected governor , @philbryantms . look forward to seeing the new civil rights museum!
cnn’s slogan is cnn , the most trusted name in news . everyone knows this is not true , that this could , in fact , be a fraud on the american public . there are many outlets that are far more trusted than fake news cnn . their slogan should be cnn , the least trusted name in news!
fake news cnn made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday . they were caught red handed , just like lonely brian ross at abc news who should be immediately fired for his mistake . watch to see if @cnn fires those responsible , or was it just gross incompetence?
a big contingent of very enthusiastic roy moore fans at the rally last night . we can’t have a pelosi/schumer liberal democrat , jones , in that important alabama senate seat . need your vote to make america great again ! jones will always vote against what we must do for our country.
great evening last night in pensacola , florida . arena was packed to the rafters , the crowd was loud , loving and really smart . they definitely get what’s going on . thank you pensacola!
we believe that every american should stand for the national anthem , and we proudly pledge allegiance to one nation under god !
this is your land , this is your home , and its your voice that matters the most . so speak up , be heard , and fight , fight , fight for the change youve been waiting for your entire life ! merry christmas and thank you pensacola , florida !
just arrived at the pensacola bay center . join me live on @foxnews in 10 minutes ! #maga
on my way to pensacola , florida . see everyone soon ! #maga
the unemployment rate remains at a 17-year low of 4.1% . the unemployment rate in manufacturing dropped to 2.6% , the lowest ever recorded . the unemployment rate among hispanics dropped to 4.7% , the lowest ever recorded . @secretaryacosta @usdol
make america great again !
fines and penalties against wells fargo bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped , as has incorrectly been reported , but will be pursued and , if anything , substantially increased . i will cut regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!
last thing the make america great again agenda needs is a liberal democrat in senate where we have so little margin for victory already . the pelosi/schumer puppet jones would vote against us 100% of the time . he’s bad on crime , life , border , vets , guns & military . vote roy moore!
big crowd expected today in pensacola , florida , for a make america great again speech . we have done so much in so short a period of time . and yet are planning to do so much more ! see you there!
i fulfilled my campaign promise - others didn’t !
tonight , @flotus melania and i were thrilled to welcome so many wonderful friends to the @whitehouse – and wish them all a very #happyhanukkah
across the battlefields , oceans , and harrowing skies of europe and the pacific throughout the war , one great battle cry could be heard by america’s friends and foes alike: remember pearl harbor .
today , as we remember pearl harbor , it was an incredible honor to be joined with surviving veterans of the attack on 12/7/1941. they are heroes , and they are living witnesses to american history . all american hearts are filled with gratitude for their service and their sacrifice .
today , the u . s. flag flies at half-staff at the @whitehouse , in honor of national pearl harbor remembrance day .
today , our entire nation pauses to remember pearl harbor—and the brave warriors who on that day stood tall and fought for america . god bless our heroes who wear the uniform , and god bless the united states of america . #pearlharborremembranceday🇺🇸
national pearl harbor remembrance day - a day that will live in infamy ! december 7, 1941
go get the new book on andrew jackson by brian kilmeade . really good . @foxandfriends
i have determined that it is time to officially recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel . i am also directing the state department to begin preparation to move the american embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem .
join me live from the @whitehouse via #periscope
our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the path of california’s wildfires . i encourage everyone to heed the advice and orders of local and state officials . thank you to all first responders for your incredible work !
make america great again!
join me this friday in pensacola , florida at the pensacola bay center ! tickets:
yesterday , i was thrilled to be with so many wonderful friends , in utah’s magnificent capitol . it was my honor to sign two presidential proclamations that will modify the national monuments designations of both bears ears and grand staircase escalante .
a must watch: legal scholar alan dershowitz was just on @foxandfriends talking of what is going on with respect to the greatest witch hunt in u . s. political history . enjoy!
with the great vote on cutting taxes , this could be a big day for the stock market - and you!
putting pelosi/schumer liberal puppet jones into office in alabama would hurt our great republican agenda of low on taxes , tough on crime , strong on military and borders . & so much more . look at your 401-k’s since election . highest stock market ever ! jobs are roaring back!
democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive tax cuts is why we need republican roy moore to win in alabama . we need his vote on stopping crime , illegal immigration , border wall , military , pro life , v . a. , judges 2nd amendment and more . no to jones , a pelosi/schumer puppet!
report: anti-trump fbi agent led clinton email probe now it all starts to make sense!
people who lost money when the stock market went down 350 points based on the false and dishonest reporting of brian ross of @abc news he has been suspended , should consider hiring a lawyer and suing abc for the damages this bad reporting has caused - many millions of dollars!
after years of comey , with the phony and dishonest clinton investigation and more , running the fbi , its reputation is in tatters - worst in history ! but fear not , we will bring it back to greatness.
tainted no , very dishonest ? fbi agent’s role in clinton probe under review . led clinton email probe . @foxandfriends clinton money going to wife of another fbi agent in charge.
such a total miscarriage of justice in san francisco !
i never asked comey to stop investigating flynn . just more fake news covering another comey lie!
congratulations to @abc news for suspending brian ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the russia , russia , russia witch hunt . more networks and papers should do the same with their fake news!
many people in our country are asking what the justice department is going to do about the fact that totally crooked hillary , after receiving a subpoena from the united states congress , deleted and acid washed 33,000 emails ? no justice!
so general flynn lies to the fbi and his life is destroyed , while crooked hillary clinton , on that now famous fbi holiday interrogation with no swearing in and no recording , lies many times . and nothing happens to her ? rigged system , or just a double standard?
great job first lady melania !
62 years ago this week , a brave seamstress in montgomery , alabama uttered one word that changed history .
i had to fire general flynn because he lied to the vice president and the fbi . he has pled guilty to those lies . it is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful . there was nothing to hide!
biggest tax bill and tax cuts in history just passed in the senate . now these great republicans will be going for final passage . thank you to house and senate republicans for your hard work and commitment!
we are one step closer to delivering massive tax cuts for working families across america . special thanks to @senatemajldr mitch mcconnell and chairman @senorrinhatch for shepherding our bill through the senate . look forward to signing a final bill before christmas !
economists on the tax cuts and jobs act: the enactment of a comprehensive overhaul - complete with a lower corporate tax rate - will ignite our economy with levels of growth not seen in generations .
the media has been speculating that i fired rex tillerson or that he would be leaving soon - fake news ! he’s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects , i call the final shots we work well together and america is highly respected again !
republicans senators are working hard to pass the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country . the bill is getting better and better . this is a once in a generation chance . obstructionist dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit!
the jury was not told the killer of kate was a 7 time felon . the schumer/pelosi democrats are so weak on crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 elections.
the kate steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected obama border , always committing crimes and being violent , and yet this info was not used in court . his exoneration is a complete travesty of justice . build the wall!
a disgraceful verdict in the kate steinle case ! no wonder the people of our country are so angry with illegal immigration.
the christmas story begins 2,000 years ago with a mother , a father , their baby son and the most extraordinary gift of all—the gift of god’s love for all of humanity . whatever our beliefs , we know that the birth of jesus christ and the story of his life .
today is a day that i’ve been looking very much forward to all year long . it is one that you have heard me speak about many times before . now , as president of the united states , it is my tremendous honor to finally wish america and the world , a very merry christmas !
our fifth 1k milestone of 2017! #dow24k #maga
today , it was my great honor to meet with the crown prince of bahrain at the @whitehouse . bahrain and the united states are important partners . during the crown prince’s visit , he is advancing $9 billion in commercial deals , including finalizing the purchase of f-16’s .
thank you @senorrinhatch . let’s continue making america great again !
the dow just broke 24,000 for the first time another all-time record . if the dems had won the presidential election , the market would be down 50% from these levels and consumer confidence , which is also at an all-time high , would be low and glum!
stock market hits new record high . confidence and enthusiasm abound . more great numbers coming out!
the chinese envoy , who just returned from north korea , seems to have had no impact on little rocket man . hard to believe his people , and the military , put up with living in such horrible conditions . russia and china condemned the launch.
the failing @nytimes has totally gone against the social media guidelines that they installed to preserve some credibility after many of their biased reporters went rogue ! @foxandfriends
the failing @nytimes , the pipe organ for the democrat party , has become a virtual lobbyist for them with regard to our massive tax cut bill . they are wrong so often that now i know we have a winner!
funny to hear the democrats talking about the national debt when president obama doubled it in only 8 years!
had the information crooked hillary’s emails been released there would have been harm to national security . charles mccullough fmr intel comm inspector general
the only people who don’t like the tax cut bill are the people that don’t understand it or the obstructionist democrats that know how really good it is and do not want the credit and success to go to the republicans!
the house of representatives seeks contempt citations ? against the justicedepartment and the fbi for withholding key documents and an fbi witness which could shed light on surveillance of associates of donald trump . big stuff . deep state . give this information now ! @foxnews
@theresa_may , don’t focus on me , focus on the destructive radical islamic terrorism that is taking place within the united kingdom . we are doing just fine!
theresa @theresamay , don’t focus on me , focus on the destructive radical islamic terrorism that is taking place within the united kingdom . we are doing just fine!
now , we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to restore american prosperity – and reclaim america’s destiny . but in order to achieve this bright and glowing future , the senate must pass tax cuts – and bring main street roaring back to life !
a vote to cut taxes is a vote to put america first . it is time to take care of our workers , to protect our communities , and to rebuild our great country !
this week , the senate can join the house & take a strong stand for the middle class families who are the backbone of america . together , we will give the american people a big , beautiful christmas present-a massive tax cut that lets americans keep more of their hard-earned money !
departing @jba_nafw for st . charles , missouri to help push our plan for historic tax cuts across the finish line . a successful vote in the senate this week will bring us one giant step closer to delivering an incredible victory for the american people !
economy growing ! excluding hurricane effects , cea estimates that real gdp growth would have been 3.9% in q3. stock market at a new high , unemployment at a low . we are winning and tax cuts will shift our economy into high gear !
just spoke to president xi jinping of china concerning the provocative actions of north korea . additional major sanctions will be imposed on north korea today . this situation will be handled!
so now that matt lauer is gone when will the fake news practitioners at nbc be terminating the contract of phil griffin ? and will they terminate low ratings joe scarborough based on the unsolved mystery that took place in florida years ago ? investigate!
so now tha matt lauer is gone when will the fake news practitioners at nbc be terminating the contract of phil griffin ? and will they terminate low ratings joe scarborough based on the unsolved mystery that took place in florida years ago ? investigate!
wow , matt lauer was just fired from nbc for inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace . but when will the top executives at nbc & comcast be fired for putting out so much fake news . check out andy lack’s past!
looks like another great day for the stock market . consumer confidence is at record high . i guess somebody likes me my policies!
great , and we should boycott fake news cnn . dealing with them is a total waste of time !
@foxandfriends , we are in record territory in all things having to do with our economy !
great day for tax cuts and the republican party . but the biggest winner will be our great country!
great work ivanka !
just won the lawsuit on leadership of consumer financial protection bureau , cfpb . a big win for the consumer!
charles mccullough , the respected fmr intel comm inspector general , said public was misled on crooked hillary emails . emails endangered national security . why aren’t our deep state authorities looking at this ? rigged & corrupt ? @tuckercarlson @seanhannity
after north korea missile launch , its more important than ever to fund our govt & military ! dems shouldnt hold troop funding hostage for amnesty & illegal immigration . i ran on stopping illegal immigration and won big . they cant now threaten a shutdown to get their demands.
the conference board said that consumer sentiment was at its highest level in nearly 17 years in november . the consumer confidence index rose from 126.2 in october to 129.5, notching its best reading since december 2000.
dow , s&p 500 and nasdaq all finished the day at new record highs !
remarks from the roosevelt room with @senatemajldr mitch mcconnell , @speakerryan and secretary of defense , general james mattis .
statement from president donald j . trump on #givingtuesday
meeting with chuck and nancy today about keeping government open and working . problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our country unchecked , are weak on crime and want to substantially raise taxes . i don’t see a deal!
melania , our great and very hard working first lady , who truly loves what she is doing , always thought that if you run , you will win . she would tell everyone that , no doubt , he will win . i also felt i would win or i would not have run - and country is doing great!
at least 24 players kneeling this weekend at nfl stadiums that are now having a very hard time filling up . the american public is fed up with the disrespect the nfl is paying to our country , our flag and our national anthem . weak and out of control!
thank you rand !
new home sales reach a 10 year high . stock market has more record gains . hopefully republican senators will give us the much needed tax cuts to keep it all going ! democrats want big tax increases.
the tax cut bill is coming along very well , great support . with just a few changes , some mathematical , the middle class and job producers can get even more in actual dollars and savings and the pass through provision becomes simpler and really works well!
the good news is that their ratings are terrible , nobody cares !
we should have a contest as to which of the networks , plus cnn and not including fox , is the most dishonest , corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite president me . they are all bad . winner to receive the fake news trophy!
back in DC , big week for tax cuts and many other things of great importance to our country . senate republicans will hopefully come through for all of us . the tax cut bill is getting better and better . the end result will be great for all!
since the first day i took office , all you hear is the phony democrat excuse for losing the election , russia , russia , russia . despite this i have the economy booming and have possibly done more than any 10 month president . make america great again!
i endorsed luther strange in the alabama primary . he shot way up in the polls but it wasn’t enough . can’t let schumer/pelosi win this race . liberal jones would be bad!
the last thing we need in alabama and the u . s. senate is a schumer/pelosi puppet who is weak on crime , weak on the border , bad for our military and our great vets , bad for our 2nd amendment , and wants to raises taxes to the sky . jones would be a disaster!
wow , even i didn’t realize we did so much . wish the fake news would report ! thank you .
@foxnews is much more important in the united states than cnn , but outside of the u . s. , cnn international is still a major source of fake news , and they represent our nation to the world very poorly . the outside world does not see the truth from them!
check out the recent editorial in the wall street journal @wsj about what a complete disaster the @cfpb has been under its leader from previous administration , who just quit!
the consumer financial protection bureau , or cfpb , has been a total disaster as run by the previous administrations pick . financial institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public . we will bring it back to life!
happy #smallbusinesssaturday ! a great day to support your community and america’s job creators by shopping locally at a #smallbiz . #shopsmall
time magazine called to say that i was probably going to be named man person of the year , like last year , but i would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot . i said probably is no good and took a pass . thanks anyway!
will be calling the president of egypt in a short while to discuss the tragic terrorist attack , with so much loss of life . we have to get tougher and smarter than ever before , and we will . need the wall , need the ban ! god bless the people of egypt.
horrible and cowardly terrorist attack on innocent and defenseless worshipers in egypt . the world cannot tolerate terrorism , we must defeat them militarily and discredit the extremist ideology that forms the basis of their existence!
after turkey call i will be heading over to trump national golf club , jupiter , to play golf quickly with tiger woods and dustin johnson . then back to mar-a-lago for talks on bringing even more jobs and companies back to the usa!
will be speaking to president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey this morning about bringing peace to the mess that i inherited in the middle east . i will get it all done , but what a mistake , in lives and dollars 6 trillion , to be there in the first place!
can you believe that the disrespect for our country , our flag , our anthem continues without penalty to the players . the commissioner has lost control of the hemorrhaging league . players are the boss !
two great people !
a great guy with great ratings !
obamacare premiums are going up , up , up , just as i have been predicting for two years . obamacare is owned by the democrats , and it is a disaster . but do not worry . even though the dems want to obstruct , we will repeal & replace right after tax cuts!
my great honor to join our incredible men and women of the @uscg , at the lake worth inlet station , in riviera beach , florida today ! #happythanksgiving
happy thanksgiving !

51 million american to travel this weekend - highest number in twelve years aaa . traffic and airports are running very smoothly ! @foxnews
the @usnavy is conducting search and rescue following aircraft crash . we are monitoring the situation . prayers for all involved .

another crooked hillary fan !
the nfl is now thinking about a new idea - keeping teams in the locker room during the national anthem next season . that’s almost as bad as kneeling ! when will the highly paid commissioner finally get tough and smart ? this issue is killing your league ! .
lavar , you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during thanksgiving with your son in china , but no nba contract to support you . but remember lavar , shoplifting is not a little thing . it’s a really big deal , especially in china . ungrateful fool!
it wasn’t the white house , it wasn’t the state department , it wasn’t father lavar’s so-called people on the ground in china that got his son out of a long term prison sentence - it was me . too bad ! lavar is just a poor man’s version of don king , but without the hair . just think.
today , we continued a wonderful american tradition at the white house . drumstick and wishbone will live out their days in the beautiful blue ridge mountains at gobbler’s rest .
president donald j . trump and @flotus melania participate in the pardoning of the national thanksgiving turkey at the white house .
under president trump unemployment rate will drop below 4% . analysts predict economic boom for 2018! @foxandfriends and @varneyco
marshawn lynch of the nfl’s oakland raiders stands for the mexican anthem and sits down to boos for our national anthem . great disrespect ! next time nfl should suspend him for remainder of season . attendance and ratings way down.
republican senators are working very hard to get tax cuts and tax reform approved . hopefully it will not be long and they do not want to disappoint the american public!
border patrol officer killed at southern border , another badly hurt . we will seek out and bring to justice those responsible . we will , and must , build the wall!
big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of elephants or any other animal.
shoplifting is a very big deal in china , as it should be 5-10 years in jail , but not to father lavar . should have gotten his son out during my next trip to china instead . china told them why they were released . very ungrateful!
sen . jeff flakey , who is unelectable in the great state of arizona quit race , anemic polls was caught purposely on mike saying bad things about your favorite president . he’ll be a no on tax cuts because his political career anyway is toast.
now that the three basketball players are out of china and saved from years in jail , lavar ball , the father of liangelo , is unaccepting of what i did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal . i should have left them in jail!
crooked hillary clinton is the worst and biggest loser of all time . she just can’t stop , which is so good for the republican party . hillary , get on with your life and give it another try in three years!
put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as i review all conservation facts . under study for years . will update soon with secretary zinke . thank you!

great numbers on stocks and the economy . if we get tax cuts and reform , well really see some great results!

congratulations to the house of representatives for passing the #taxcutsandjobsact — a big step toward fulfilling our promise to deliver historic tax cuts for the american people by the end of the year !

to the three ucla basketball players i say: youre welcome , go out and give a big thank you to president xi jinping of china who made.
big vote tomorrow in the house . tax cuts are getting close!
why are democrats fighting massive tax cuts for the middle class and business jobs ? the reason: obstruction and delay!
it is actually hard to believe how naive or dumb the failing @nytimes is when it comes to foreign policy . weak and ineffective!
they should realize that these relationships are a good thing , not a bad thing . the u . s. is being respected again . watch trade!
the failing @nytimes hates the fact that i have developed a great relationship with world leaders like xi jinping , president of china.
do you think the three ucla basketball players will say thank you president trump ? they were headed for 10 years in jail!
thank you !
thank you , working hard !
while in the philippines i was forced to watch @cnn , which i have not done in months , and again realized how bad , and fake , it is . loser!

i will be making a major statement from the @whitehouse upon my return to DC time and date to be set.
just arrived at #asean50 in the philippines for my final stop with world leaders . will lead to fair trade deals , unlike the horror shows from past administrations . will then be leaving for DC made many good friends!
after my tour of asia , all countries dealing with us on trade know that the rules have changed . the united states has to be treated fairly and in a reciprocal fashion . the massive trade deficits must go down quickly!
great to see @randpaul looking well and back on the senate floor . he will help us with tax cuts and reform!
excited to be heading home to see the house pass a great tax bill with the middle class getting big tax cuts ! #makeamericagreatagain🇺🇸
i am proud of the rep . house & senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform . } we’re getting close ! now , how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular indiv mandate in ocare & reducing taxes even further ? cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?

why would kim jong-un insult me by calling me old , when i would never call him short and fat ? oh well , i try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!
does the fake news media remember when crooked hillary clinton , as secretary of state , was begging russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button ? obama tried also , but he had zero chemistry with putin.
when will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with russia is a good thing , not a bad thing . there always playing politics - bad for our country . i want to solve north korea , syria , ukraine , terrorism , and russia can greatly help!
met with president putin of russia who was at #apec meetings . good discussions on syria . hope for his help to solve , along with china the dangerous north korea crisis . progress being made.
will be doing a joint press conference in hanoi , vietnam then heading for final destination of trip , the phillipines.

my meetings with president xi jinping were very productive on both trade and the subject of north korea . he is a highly respected and powerful representative of his people . it was great being with him and madame peng liyuan!
i don’t blame china , i blame the incompetence of past admins for allowing china to take advantage of the u . s. on trade leading up to a point where the u . s. is losing $100s of billions . how can you blame china for taking advantage of people that had no clue ? i wouldve done same!
in the coming months and years ahead i look forward to building an even stronger relationship between the united states and china . 🇺🇸🇨🇳

together , we dream of a korea that is free , a peninsula that is safe , and families that are reunited once again !
anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the u . s. should look to our past . and you will doubt it no longer .
the north korean regime has pursued its nuclear & ballistic missile programs in defiance of every assurance , agreement , & commmitment it has made to the u . s. and its allies . its broken all of those commitments .
the u . s. , under my administration , is completely rebuilding its military , and theyre spending hundreds of billions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world , being built right now . i want peace through strength !
join me live in south korea🇺🇸🇰🇷 #nationalassembly #potusinasia ➡

jobs , jobs , jobs !
the rigged dem primary , one of the biggest political stories in years , got zero coverage on fake news network tv last night . disgraceful!
just took off for ceremony @ pearl harbor . will then be heading to japan , skorea , china , vietnam & the philippines . will never let you down!
i always felt i would be running and winning against bernie sanders , not crooked h , without cheating , i was right.
bernie sanders supporters have every right to be apoplectic of the complete theft of the dem primary by crooked hillary!
based on that , the military has hit isis much harder over the last two days . they will pay a big price for every attack on us!
isis just claimed the degenerate animal who killed , and so badly wounded , the wonderful people on the west side , was their soldier . .
pocahontas just stated that the democrats , lead by the legendary crooked hillary clinton , rigged the primaries ! lets go fbi & justice dept.
the real story on collusion is in donna bs new book . crooked hillary bought the dnc & then stole the democratic primary from crazy bernie!
people are angry . at some point the justice department , and the fbi , must do what is right and proper . the american public deserves it!
new donna b book says she paid for and stole the dem primary . what about the deleted e-mails , uranium , podesta , the server , plus , plus.
everybody is asking why the justice department and fbi isnt looking into all of the dishonesty going on with crooked hillary & the dems.
my twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee . i guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact.
i will be interviewed by @ingrahamangle on @foxnews at 10:00. enjoy!
the @tuckercarlson opening statement about our once cherished and great fbi was so sad to watch . james comeys leadership was a disaster!

there is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed . should move fast . death penalty!
would love to send the nyc terrorist to guantanamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the federal system.
nyc terrorist was happy as he asked to hang isis flag in his hospital room . he killed 8 people , badly injured 12. should get death penalty!
great mtg w/ @cabinet today . tomorrow , i will be announcing the new head of the fed . i think you will be extremely impressed by this person !
happy birthday to @garyplayer , a truly great champion and person!

just spoke with @nygovcuomo and @nycmayor de blasio to let them know that the federal government.
we mourn the horrifying terrorist attack in nyc . all of america is praying and grieving for the families who lost their precious loved ones .
for the middle class . the house and senate should consider asap as the process of final approval moves along . push biggest tax cuts ever
wouldnt it be great to repeal the very unfair and unpopular individual mandate in obamacare and use those savings for further tax cuts.
#nycstrong #usa🇺🇸
senator chuck schumer helping to import europes problems said col . tony shaffer . we will stop this craziness ! @foxandfriends

the terrorist came into our country through what is called the diversity visa lottery program , a chuck schumer beauty . i want merit based.
i have just ordered homeland security to step up our already extreme vetting program . being politically correct is fine , but not for this!
the republican house members are working hard and late toward the massive tax cuts that they know you deserve . these will be biggest ever!
my thoughts , condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the new york city terrorist attack . god and your country are with you!
we must not allow isis to return , or enter , our country after defeating them in the middle east and elsewhere . enough!
in nyc , looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person . law enforcement is following this closely . not in the u . s.a . !

statement by president trump on the apprehension of mustafa al-imam for his alleged role in benghazi attacks
earth shattering . he and his brother could drain the swamp , which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled . fake news weak!
the biggest story yesterday , the one that has the dems in a dither , is podesta running from his firm . what he know about crooked dems is.
i hope people will start to focus on our massive tax cuts for business jobs and the middle class in addition to democrat corruption!
came to the campaign . few people knew the young , low level volunteer named george , who has already proven to be a liar . check the dems!
the fake news is working overtime . as paul manaforts lawyer said , there was no collusion and events mentioned took place long before he.
also , there is no collusion!
sorry , but this is years ago , before paul manafort was part of the trump campaign . but why arent crooked hillary & the dems the focus ? ?? ? ?
great job by michaelcaputo on @foxandfriends.
report out that obama campaign paid $972,000 to fusion gps . the firm also got $12,400,000 really ? from dnc . nobody knows who okd!
all of this russia talk right when the republicans are making their big push for historic tax cuts & reform . is this coincidental ? not!
are now fighting back like never before . there is so much guilt by democrats/clinton , and now the facts are pouring out . do something!
collusion , which doesnt exist . the dems are using this terrible and bad for our country witch hunt for evil politics , but the rs.
the uranium to russia deal , the 33,000 plus deleted emails , the comey fix and so much more . instead they look at phony trump/russia , .
never seen such republican anger & unity as i have concerning the lack of investigation on clinton made fake dossier now $12,000,000? , .
as usual , the obamacare premiums will be up the dems own it , but we will repeal & replace and have great healthcare soon after tax cuts!
jfk files are released , long ahead of schedule!
while not at all presidential i must point out that the sloppy michael moore show on broadway was a total bomb and was forced to close . sad!

i am supportive of lamar as a person & also of the process , but i can never support bailing out ins cos who have made a fortune w/ ocare.
democrat congresswoman totally fabricated what i said to the wife of a soldier who died in action and i have proof . sad!
the nfl has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our national anthem . total disrespect for our great country!
as it has turned out , james comey lied and leaked and totally protected hillary clinton . he was the best thing that ever happened to her!
the democrats will only vote for tax increases . hopefully , all senate republicans will vote for the largest tax cuts in u . s. history.
people not interviewed , including clinton herself . comey stated under oath that he didnt do this-obviously a fix ? where is justice dept?
wow , fbi confirms report that james comey drafted letter exonerating crooked hillary clinton long before investigation was complete . many.
the most important truth our founders understood was: freedom is not a gift from govt . freedom is a gift from god . 🎥

health insurance stocks , which have gone through the roof during the obamacare years , plunged yesterday after i ended their dems windfall!

money pouring into insurance companies profits , under the guise of obamacare , is over . they have made a fortune . dems must get smart & deal!

hard to believe that the democrats , who have gone so far left that they are no longer recognizable , are fighting so hard for sanctuary crime
obamacare is a broken mess . piece by piece we will now begin the process of giving america the great healthcare it deserves!
sadly , they and others are fake news , and the public is just beginning to figure it out !
the democrats obamacare is imploding . massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped . dems should call me to fix!
it is time to take care of our country , to rebuild our communities , and to protect our great american workers ! #taxreform
people are just now starting to find out how dishonest and disgusting fakenews @nbcnews is . viewers beware . may be worse than even @cnn!

we cannot keep fema , the military & the first responders , who have been amazing under the most difficult circumstances in p . r. forever!
accountability say the governor . electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes . congress to decide how much to spend.
puerto rico survived the hurricanes , now a financial crisis looms largely of their own making . says sharyl attkisson . a total lack of.

with all of the fake news coming out of nbc and the networks , at what point is it appropriate to challenge their license ? bad for country!
fake @nbcnews made up a story that i wanted a tenfold increase in our u . s. nuclear arsenal . pure fiction , made up to demean . nbc = cnn!
it is about time that roger goodell of the nfl is finally demanding that all players stand for our great national anthem-respect our country
the democrats want massive tax increases & soft , crime producing borders . the republicans want the biggest tax cut in history & the wall!
it would be really nice if the fake news media would report the virtually unprecedented stock market growth since the election . need tax cuts
if congress gives us the massive tax cuts and reform i am asking for , those numbers will grow by leaps and bounds . #maga
stock market has increased by 5.2 trillion dollars since the election on november 8th , a 25% increase . lowest unemployment in 16 years and.
fired . this story is totally made up by the dishonest media . the chief is doing a fantastic job for me and , more importantly , for the usa!
the fake news is at it again , this time trying to hurt one of the finest people i know , general john kelly , by saying he will soon be.
my great honor to host the 2017 back-to-back #stanleycup champion pittsburgh penguins at the wh with @flotus today !
the failing @nytimes set liddle bob corker up by recording his conversation . was made to sound a fool , and thats what i am dealing with!
highly respected author , christopher bedford , just came out with book , the art of the donald , lessons from americas . really good book!
with jemele hill at the mike , it is no wonder espn ratings have tanked , in fact , tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!
since congress cant get its act together on healthcare , i will be using the power of the pen to give great healthcare to many people - fast
the problem with agreeing to a policy on immigration is that the democrats dont want secure borders , they dont care about safety for u . s.a.
why is the nfl getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our anthem , flag and country ? change tax law!
we have just begun !
a big salute to jerry jones , owner of the dallas cowboys , who will bench players who disrespect our flag . stand for anthem or sit for game!
president donald j . trump proclaims october 9, 2017, as #columbusday
the trip by @vp pence was long planned . he is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!
our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with north korea for 25 years , giving billions of dollars & getting nothing . policy didnt work!
the republican party is racking up record amounts of small dollar donations - fueled by trump supporters . @nypost thank you!
nobody could have done what i’ve done for #puertorico with so little appreciation . so much work !
bob corker gave us the iran deal , & thats about it . we need healthcare , we need tax cuts/reform , we need people that can get the job done!
fema and first responders are working hard yet again on hurricane nate . military helping . very much under control!
i asked @vp pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled , disrespecting our country . i am proud of him and @secondlady karen.
hence , i would fully expect corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda . didnt have the guts to run!
my endorsement . he also wanted to be secretary of state , i said no thanks . he is also largely responsible for the horrendous iran deal!
senator bob corker begged me to endorse him for re-election in tennessee . i said no and he dropped out said he could not win without.
#lasvegasstrong #usa🇺🇸 🎥
leaving the white house for the great state of north carolina . big progress being made on many fronts!

our great team at @fema is prepared for #hurricanenate . everyone in la , ms , al , and fl please listen to your local authorities & be safe!
@nbcnews is so knowingly inaccurate with their reporting . the good news is that the people get it , which is really all that matters ! not #1
i called chuck schumer yesterday to see if the dems want to do a great healthcare bill . obamacare is badly broken , big premiums . who knows!
more and more people are suggesting that republicans and me should be given equal time on t . v. when you look at the one-sided coverage?
late night host are dealing with the democrats for their very unfunny & repetitive material , always anti-trump ! should we get equal time?
contributions . the rnc is taking in far more $s than the dems , and much of it by my wonderful small donors . i am working hard for them!
cant believe i finally got a good story in the @washingtonpost . it discusses the enthusiasm of trump voters through campaign.
ralph northam , who is running for governor of virginia , is fighting for the violent ms-13 killer gangs & sanctuary cities . vote ed gillespie!
rex tillerson never threatened to resign . this is fake news put out by @nbcnews . low news and reporting standards . no verification from me.
stock market hits an all-time high ! unemployment lowest in 16 years ! business and manufacturing enthusiasm at highest level in decades!
why isnt the senate intel committee looking into the fake news networks in our country to see why so much of our news is just made up-fake!
thank you !
so wonderful to be in las vegas yesterday and meet with people , from police to doctors to the victims themselves , who i will never forget!
on behalf of a grateful nation , thank you to all of the first responders heroes who saved countless lives in las vegas on sunday night .
we love you las vegas !
i will be landing in las vegas shortly to pay my respects with @flotus melania . everyone remains in our thoughts and prayers.
the @nbcnews story has just been totally refuted by sec . tillerson and @vp pence . it is #fakenews . they should issue an apology to america!
nbc news is #fakenews and more dishonest than even cnn . they are a disgrace to good reporting . no wonder their news ratings are way down!
wow , so many fake news stories today . no matter what i do or say , they will not write or speak truth . the fake news media is out of control!
a great day in puerto rico yesterday . while some of the news coverage is fake , most showed great warmth and friendship.
my administration will continue to work around the clock with governor @ricardorossello & his team . great progress being made ! #prstrong🇵🇷
it is a miracle how fast the las vegas metropolitan police were able to find the demented shooter and stop him from even more killing!
so proud of @fema , military , and first responders ! thank you !
great meeting with governor mapp of the #usvi . he is very thankful for the great job done by @fema and first responders .

being nice to rocket man hasnt worked in 25 years , why would it work now ? clinton failed , bush failed , and obama failed . i wont fail.
save your energy rex , well do what has to be done!
i told rex tillerson , our wonderful secretary of state , that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with little rocket man.
for safety . thank you to the governor of p . r. and to all of those who are working so closely with our first responders . fantastic job!
people are now starting to recognize the amazing work that has been done by fema and our great military . all buildings now inspected.
we have done a great job with the almost impossible situation in puerto rico . outside of the fake news or politically motivated ingrates , .

in analyzing the alabama primary race , fake news always fails to mention that the candidate i endorsed went up many points after endorsement!
in analyzing the alabama primary race , fake news always fails to mention that the candidate i endorsed went up many points after election!
because of #fakenews my people are not getting the credit they deserve for doing a great job . as seen here , they are all doing a great job !
very important that nfl players stand tomorrow , and always , for the playing of our national anthem . respect our flag and our country!
i will be in pr on tues . to further ensure we continue doing everything possible to assist & support the people in their time of great need.

the governor of puerto rico , ricardo rossello , is a great guy and leader who is really working hard . thank you ricky!
despite the fake news media in conjunction with the dems , an amazing job is being done in puerto rico . great people!
the fake news networks are working overtime in puerto rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first rs . shame!
i will be going to puerto rico on tuesday with melania . will hopefully be able to stop at the u . s. virgin islands people working hard.
fake news cnn and nbc are going out of their way to disparage our great first responders as a way to get trump . not fair to fr or effort!
the military and first responders , despite no electric , roads , phones etc . , have done an amazing job . puerto rico was totally destroyed.
want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort . 10,000 federal workers now on island doing a fantastic job.
such poor leadership ability by the mayor of san juan , and others in puerto rico , who are not able to get their workers to help . they.
the mayor of san juan , who was very complimentary only a few days ago , has now been told by the democrats that you must be nasty to trump.
@impdnews @potus thank you to the amazing indianapolis metropolitan police department and all law enforcement officers , for all you do 24/7/365! #lesm

thank you to fema , our great military & all first responders who are working so hard , against terrible odds , in puerto rico . see you tuesday!
the fact is that puerto rico has been destroyed by two hurricanes . big decisions will have to be made as to the cost of its rebuilding!
puerto rico governor ricardo rossello just stated: the administration and the president , every time weve spoken , theyve delivered.
gdp was revised upward to 3.1 for last quarter . many people thought it would be years before that happened . we have just begun!
puerto rico is devastated . phone system , electric grid many roads , gone . fema and first responders are amazing . governor said great job!
really hard to help but many have lost their homes . military is now on site and i will be there tuesday . wish press would treat fairly!
fema & first responders are doing a great job in puerto rico . massive food & water delivered . docks & electric grid dead . locals trying.
welcome back @stevescalise ! #teamscalise
the electric power grid in puerto rico is totally shot . large numbers of generators are now on island . food and water on site.
democrats dont want massive tax cuts - how does that win elections ? great reviews for tax cut and reform bill.
it is time to take care of our people , to rebuild our nation , and to fight for our great american workers ! #taxreform #usa🇺🇸
this is the right tax cut @ the right time . we will all succeed & grow together – as one team , one people , & one american family . #taxreform
just arrived in indianapolis , indiana to make an announcement on #taxreform ! together , we are going to make america great again !
but the people were pro-trump ! virtually no president has accomplished what we have accomplished in the first 9 months-and economy roaring
facebook was always anti-trump . the networks were always anti-trump hence , fake news , @nytimesapologized & @wapo were anti-trump . collusion?
we will have the votes for healthcare but not for the reconciliation deadline of friday , after which we need 60. get rid of filibuster rule!
with one yes vote in hospital & very positive signs from alaska and two others mccain is out , we have the hcare vote , but not for friday!

alabama , get out and vote for luther strange - he has proven to me that he will never let you down ! #maga
the nfl has all sorts of rules and regulations . the only way out for them is to set a rule that you cant kneel during our national anthem!
thank you to carmen yulin cruz , the mayor of san juan , for your kind words on fema etc . we are working hard . much food and water there/on way
great interview on @foxandfriends with the parents of otto warmbier: 1994 - 2017. otto was tortured beyond belief by north korea.
luther strange has been shooting up in the alabama polls since my endorsement . finish the job - vote today for big luther.
but while dallas dropped to its knees as a team , they all stood up for our national anthem . big progress being made-we all love our country!
but while dallas dropped to it knees as a team , they all stood up for our national anthem . big progress being made - we love our country!
the booing at the nfl football game last night , when the entire dallas team dropped to its knees , was loudest i have ever heard . great anger
ratings for nfl football are way down except before game starts , when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!
big election tomorrow in the great state of alabama . vote for senator luther strange , tough on crime & border - will never let you down!
a few of the many clips of john mccain talking about repealing & replacing ocare . my oh my has he changed-complete turn from years of talk !
owed to wall street and the banks which , sadly , must be dealt with . food , water and medical are top priorities - and doing well . #fema
its old electrical grid , which was in terrible shape , was devastated . much of the island was destroyed , with billions of dollars.
texas & florida are doing great but puerto rico , which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt , is in deep trouble.
tremendous backlash against the nfl and its players for disrespect of our country . #standforouranthem🇺🇸
general john kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on nfl players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our flag or great country!
@cnn is #fakenews . just reported cos john kelly was opposed to my stance on nfl players disrespecting flag , anthem , country . total lie!
#standforouranthem
the white house never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night . important meetings taking place today . big tax cuts & reform.
the issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race . it is about respect for our country , flag and national anthem . nfl must respect this!
many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday which was a small percentage of total . these are fans who demand respect for our flag!
so proud of nascar and its supporters and fans . they wont put up with disrespecting our country or our flag - they said it loud and clear!
making america safe is my number one priority . we will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet .
sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their national anthem or their country . nfl should change policy!
alaska , arizona , maine and kentucky are big winners in the healthcare proposal . 7 years of repeal & replace and some senators not there.
courageous patriots have fought and died for our great american flag - we must honor and respect it ! make america great again!
please to inform that the champion pittsburgh penguins of the nhl will be joining me at the white house for ceremony . great team!
great solidarity for our national anthem and for our country . standing with locked arms is good , kneeling is not acceptable . bad ratings!
nfl attendance and ratings are way down . boring games yes , but many stay away because they love our country . league should back u . s.
if nfl fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our flag & country , you will see change take place fast . fire or suspend!
just heard foreign minister of north korea speak at u . n. if he echoes thoughts of little rocket man , they wont be around much longer!
roger goodell of nfl just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country . tell them to stand!
democrats are laughingly saying that mccain had a moment of courage . tell that to the people of arizona who were deceived . 116% increase!
iran just test-fired a ballistic missile capable of reaching israel . they are also working with north korea . not much of an agreement we have!
very proud of our incredible first lady @flotus . she is a truly great representative for our country !
our great american flag or country and should stand for the national anthem . if not , youre fired . find something else to do!
if a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the nfl , or other leagues , he or she should not be allowed to disrespect.
going to the white house is considered a great honor for a championship team . stephen curry is hesitating , therefore invitation is withdrawn!
it was great being with luther strange last night in alabama . what great people , what a crowd ! vote luther on tuesday.
alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under obamacare , worst in the country . deductibles high , people angry ! lisa m comes through.
i know rand paul and i think he may find a way to get there for the good of the party!
large block grants to states is a good thing to do . better control & management . great for arizona . mccain let his best friend l . g. down!
arizona had a 116% increase in obamacare premiums last year , with deductibles very high . chuck schumer sold john mccain a bill of goods . sad
john mccain never had any intention of voting for this bill , which his governor loves . he campaigned on repeal & replace . let arizona down!
heading to alabama now , big crowd!
thank you to doug parker and american airlines for all of the help you have given to the u . s. with hurricane flights . fantastic job!
#usaatunga🇺🇸#unga
will be in alabama tonight . luther strange has gained mightily since my endorsement , but will be very close . he loves alabama , and so do i!
the greatest influence over our election was the fake news media screaming for crooked hillary clinton . next , she was a bad candidate!
the russia hoax continues , now its ads on facebook . what about the totally biased and dishonest media coverage in favor of crooked hillary?
thank you !
kim jong un of north korea , who is obviously a madman who doesnt mind starving or killing his people , will be tested like never before!
rand paul , or whoever votes against hcare bill , will forever future political campaigns be known as the republican who saved obamacare.
a big day for the u . s. at the united nations!
senator luther strange has gone up a lot in the polls since i endorsed him a month ago . now a close runoff . he will be great in DC

senator doctor bill cassidy is a class act who really cares about people and their healthcare , he doesnt lie-just wants to help people!
the nra strongly endorses luther strange for senator of alabama . that means all gun owners should vote for big luther . he wont let you down!
i would not sign graham-cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions . it does ! a great bill . repeal & replace.
alabama is sooo lucky to have a candidate like big luther strange . smart , tough on crime , borders & trade , loves vets & military . tuesday!

looking forward to friday night in the great state of alabama . i am supporting big luther strange because he was so loyal & helpful to me!
i hope republican senators will vote for graham-cassidy and fulfill their promise to repeal & replace obamacare . money direct to states!
rand paul is a friend of mine but he is such a negative force when it comes to fixing healthcare . graham-cassidy bill is great ! ends ocare!
thank you @foxandfriends - great show!
the world is noticing , thanks !
after allowing north korea to research and build nukes while secretary of state bill c also , crooked hillary now criticizes.

chain migration cannot be allowed to be part of any legislation on immigration!
espn is paying a really big price for its politics and bad programming . people are dumping it in record numbers . apologize for untruth!
we have made more progress in the last nine months against isis than the obama administration has made in 8 years . must be proactive & nasty!
the travel ban into the united states should be far larger , tougher and more specific-but stupidly , that would not be politically correct!
loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner . the internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off & use better!
another attack in london by a loser terrorist . these are sick and demented people who were in the sights of scotland yard . must be proactive!
with the ridiculous filibuster rule in the senate , republicans need 60 votes to pass legislation , rather than 51. cant get votes , end now!
florida- just like tx , we are w/you today , we are w/you tomorrow , & we will be w/you every single day after , to restore , recover , & rebuild !

am leaving now for florida to see our great first responders and to thank the u . s. coast guard , fema etc . a real disaster , much work to do!
they have been in our country for many years through no fault of their own - brought in by parents at young age . plus big border security
does anybody really want to throw out good , educated and accomplished young people who have jobs , some serving in the military ? really ! .
the wall , which is already under construction in the form of new renovation of old and existing fences and walls , will continue to be built.
no deal was made last night on daca . massive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent . would be subject to vote.
the deplorables came back to haunt hillary . they expressed their feelings loud and clear . she spent big money but , in the end , had no game!
crooked hillary clinton blames everybody and every thing but herself for her election loss . she lost the debates and lost her direction!
china has a business tax rate of 15% . we should do everything possible to match them in order to win with our economy . jobs and wages!

churches in texas should be entitled to reimbursement from fema relief funds for helping victims of hurricane harvey just like others.
a message to my fellow americans🇺🇸#irmahurricane2017 🎥 🎥
republicans must start the tax reform/tax cut legislation asap . dont wait until the end of september . needed now more than ever . hurry!
never allow the republicans to pass even great legislation . 8 dems control - will rarely get 60 vs . 51 votes . it is a repub death wish!
republicans , sorry , but ive been hearing about repeal & replace for 7 years , didnt happen ! even worse , the senate filibuster rule will.
our incredible u . s. coast guard saved more than 15,000 lives last week with harvey . irma could be even tougher . we love our coast guard!
hurricane irma is of epic proportion , perhaps bigger than we have ever seen . be safe and get out of its way , if possible . federal g is ready!
we will confront any challenge , no matter how strong the winds or high the water . i’m proud to stand with presidents for #oneamericaappeal.
i encourage everyone in the path of #hurricaneirma to heed the advice and orders of local & state officials !
during my trip to saudi arabia , i spoke to the leaders of more than 50 arab & muslim nations about the need to confront our shared enemies .

the united states is considering , in addition to other options , stopping all trade with any country doing business with north korea.
i will be meeting general kelly , general mattis and other military leaders at the white house to discuss north korea . thank you.
south korea is finding , as i have told them , that their talk of appeasement with north korea will not work , they only understand one thing!
north korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to china , which is trying to help but with little success.
north korea has conducted a major nuclear test . their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the united states.
so much spirit in la ! thank you to all of our hereos who saved many lives . an honor to spend time w/ @nationalguard , #leos & the #cajunnavy !

senator mitch mcconnell said i had excessive expectations , but i dont think so . after 7 years of hearing repeal & replace , why not done?
hopefully we will never have to use this power , but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!

how much longer will the failing nytimes , with its big losses and massive unfunded liability and non-existent sources , remain in business?

on #purpleheartday💜i thank all the brave men and women who have sacrificed in battle for this great nation ! #usa🇺🇸
conquests , how brave he was , and it was all a lie . he cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child . now he judges collusion?
never in u . s.history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like senator richard blumenthal . he told stories about his vietnam battles and.
interesting to watch senator richard blumenthal of connecticut talking about hoax russian collusion when he was a phony vietnam con artist!
working hard from new jersey while white house goes through long planned renovation . going to new york next week for more meetings.
hard to believe that with 24/7 #fake news on cnn , abc , nbc , cbs , nytimes & wapo , the trump base is getting stronger!
 supreme court pick , economic enthusiasm , deregulation & so much more have driven the trump base even closer together . will never change!
and west virginia . the fact is the fake news russian collusion story , record stock market , border security , military strength , jobs.
the trump base is far bigger & stronger than ever before despite some phony fake news polling . look at rallies in penn , iowa , ohio.
the failing @nytimes , which has made every wrong prediction about me including my big election win apologized , is totally inept!
just completed call with president moon of south korea . very happy and impressed with 15-0 united nations vote on north korea sanctions.
the fake news refuses to report the success of the first 6 months: s . c. , surging economy & jobs , border & military security , isis & ms-13 etc.

our relationship with russia is at an all-time & very dangerous low . you can thank congress , the same people that cant even give us hcare!
i am continuing to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations . much work left to do but effect will be great ! business & jobs will grow.
business is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels . stock market at an all-time high . that doesnt just happen!
i love the white house , one of the most beautiful buildings homes i have ever seen . but fake news said i called it a dump - totally untrue
i campaigned on creating a merit-based immigration system that protects u . s. workers & taxpayers . watch: #raiseact
why the rust belt just gave donald trump a heros welcome
it was my great honor to pay tribute to a vet who went above & beyond the call of duty to protect our comrades , our country , & our freedom !
small business owners are the dreamers & innovators who are powering us into the future ! read more and watch here:
only the fake news media and trump enemies want me to stop using social media 110 million people . only way for me to get the truth out!
corporations have never made as much money as they are making now . thank you stuart varney @foxandfriends jobs are starting to roar , watch!
stock market could hit all-time high again 22,000 today . was 18,000 only 6 months ago on election day . mainstream media seldom mentions!
a great day at the white house!
highest stock market ever , best economic numbers in years , unemployment lowest in 17 years , wages raising , border secure , s . c.: no wh chaos!
if obamacare is hurting people , & it is , why shouldnt it hurt the insurance companies & why should congress not be paying what public pays?
dont give up republican senators , the world is watching: repeal & replace . and go to 51 votes nuke option , get cross state lines & more.
they do nothing for us with north korea , just talk . we will no longer allow this to continue . china could easily solve this problem!
i am very disappointed in china . our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade , yet.
i love reading about all of the geniuses who were so instrumental in my election success . problem is , most dont exist . #fake news ! maga
unless the republican senators are total quitters , repeal & replace is not dead ! demand another vote before voting on any other bill!
u . s. stock market up almost 20% since election!
if a new healthcare bill is not approved quickly , bailouts for insurance companies and bailouts for members of congress will end very soon!
after seven years of talking repeal & replace , the people of our great country are still being forced to live with imploding obamacare!
if the senate democrats ever got the chance , they would switch to a 51 majority vote in first minute . they are laughing at rs . make change!
8 dems totally control the u . s. senate . many great republican bills will never pass , like kates law and complete healthcare . get smart!
republicans in the senate will never win if they dont go to a 51 vote majority now . they look like fools and are just wasting time.
the very outdated filibuster rule must go . budget reconciliation is killing rs in senate . mitch m , go to 51 votes now and win . its time!
republican senate must get rid of 60 vote now ! it is killing the r party , allows 8 dems to control country . 200 bills sit in senate . a joke!
in other words , russia was against trump in the 2016 election - and why not , i want strong military & low oil prices . witch hunt !
we will defend our country , protect our communities and put the safety of the american people first ! replay:
i would like to thank reince priebus for his service and dedication to his country . we accomplished a lot together and i am proud of him!
and a great leader . john has also done a spectacular job at homeland security . he has been a true star of my administration
i am pleased to inform you that i have just named general/secretary john f kelly as white house chief of staff . he is a great american.
departing for long island now . an area under siege from #ms13 gang members . we will not rest until #ms13 is eradicated . #lesm
we will always enforce our laws , protect our borders , and support our police ! #lesm harrisburg , pennsylvania #flashbackfriday #ms13
even though parts of healthcare could pass at 51, some really good things need 60. so many great future bills & budgets need 60 votes.
if republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the senate , they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority , not senseless 60.
3 republicans and 48 democrats let the american people down . as i said from the beginning , let obamacare implode , then deal . watch!
go republican senators , go ! get there after waiting for 7 years . give america great healthcare!
it was my great honor to present our nations highest award for a public safety officer - the medal of valor to five american heroes !
today , we gathered in the east room to pay tribute to the heroes whose courageous actions under fire saved so many lives in alexandria , va .
join me live as we recognize the first responders to the june 14th shooting involving @stevescalise . #teamscalise
big progress being made in ridding our country of ms-13 gang members and gang members in general . make america safe again!
about then candidate trump . catherine herridge @foxnews . so why doesnt fake news report this ? witch hunt ! purposely phony reporting.
one of the things that has been lost in the politics of this situation is that the russians collected and spread negative information.
come on republican senators , you can do it on healthcare . after 7 years , this is your chance to shine ! dont let the american people down!
wow , the failing @nytimes said about @foxandfriends . the most powerful t . v. show in america.
thank you foxconn , for investing $10 billion dollars with the potential for up to 13k new jobs in wisconsin ! madeintheusa🇺🇸
congratulations to boys and girls nation . it was my great honor to welcome you to the wh today ! full remarks:

big dollars $700,000 for his wifes political run from hillary clinton and her representatives . drain the swamp!
why didnt a . g. sessions replace acting fbi director andrew mccabe , a comey friend who was in charge of clinton investigation but got.
victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail . thank you
transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the u . s. military . our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming.
after consultation with my generals and military experts , please be advised that the united states government will not accept or allow.
senator @lisamurkowski of the great state of alaska really let the republicans , and our country , down yesterday . too bad!
the crowd in ohio was amazing last night - broke all records . we all had a great time in a great state . will be back soon!
people of ohio are fantastic . thank you so much . what an evening !
it was my great honor to join our wonderful veterans at amvets post 44 in youngstown , ohio this evening . a grateful nation salutes you !

this will be a very interesting day for healthcare . the dems are obstructionists but the republicans can have a great victory for the people!
working on major trade deal with the united kingdom . could be very big & exciting . jobs ! the e . u. is very protectionist with the u . s. stop!
jared kushner did very well yesterday in proving he did not collude with the russians . witch hunt . next up , 11 year old barron trump!
so great that john mccain is coming back to vote . brave - american hero ! thank you john.
obamacare is torturing the american people . the democrats have fooled the people long enough . repeal or repeal & replace ! i have pen in hand.
big day for healthcare . after 7 years of talking , we will soon see whether or not republicans are willing to step up to the plate!
problem is that the acting head of the fbi & the person in charge of the hillary investigation , andrew mccabe , got $700,000 from h for wife!
attorney general jeff sessions has taken a very weak position on hillary clinton crimes where are e-mails & dnc server & intel leakers!
ukrainian efforts to sabotage trump campaign - quietly working to boost clinton . so where is the investigation a . g. @seanhannity
is fake news washington post being used as a lobbyist weapon against congress to keep politicians from looking into amazon no-tax monopoly?
so many stories about me in the @washingtonpost are fake news . they are as bad as ratings challenged @cnn . lobbyist for amazon and taxes?
the amazon washington post fabricated the facts on my ending massive , dangerous , and wasteful payments to syrian rebels fighting assad.
#2017jambo- remember your duty . honor your history . take care of the people god puts into your life – and love & cherish your country !
any senator who votes against starting debate is telling america that you are fine w/ the #ocarenightmare ! remarks:
arriving at joint base andrews with @secretaryperry , @secretaryzinke , and @secpricemd .
republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on repeal & replace after years of talking & campaigning on it.
sleazy adam schiff , the totally biased congressman looking into russia , spends all of his time on television pushing the dem loss excuse!
so why arent the committees and investigators , and of course our beleaguered a . g. , looking into crooked hillarys crimes & russia relations?
after 1 year of investigation with zero evidence being found , chuck schumer just stated that democrats should blame ourselves , not russia.
drain the swamp should be changed to drain the sewer - its actually much worse than anyone ever thought , and it begins with the fake news!
thank you to @loudobbs for giving the first six months of the trump administration an a+ . s . c. , reg cutting , stock m , jobs , border etc . = true!
if republicans dont repeal and replace the disastrous obamacare , the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand!
its hard to read the failing new york times or the amazon washington post because every story/opinion , even if should be positive , is bad!
its very sad that republicans , even some that were carried over the line on my back , do very little to protect their president.
as the phony russian witch hunt continues , two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold , democrats and russians!
to every patriot who will serve on the #ussgeraldrford: ☑keep the watch🇺🇸 ☑protect her🇺🇸 ☑defend her🇺🇸 ☑love her🇺🇸 good luck & godspeed !

obamacare is dead and the democrats are obstructionists , no ideas or votes , only obstruction . it is solely up to the 52 republican senators!
the republican senators must step up to the plate and , after 7 years , vote to repeal and replace . next , tax reform and infrastructure . win!
in all fairness to anthony scaramucci , he wanted to endorse me 1st , before the republican primaries started , but didnt think i was running!
my son donald openly gave his e-mails to the media & authorities whereas crooked hillary clinton deleted & acid washed her 33,000 e-mails!
what about all of the clinton ties to russia , including podesta company , uranium deal , russian reset , big dollar speeches etc.
so many people are asking why isnt the a . g. or special council looking at the many hillary clinton or comey crimes . 33,000 e-mails deleted?
while all agree the u . s . president has the complete power to pardon , why think of that when only crime so far is leaks against us . fake news
this morning i will be going to the commissioning ceremony for the largest aircraft carrier in the world , the gerald r . ford . norfolk , va.
the failing new york times foiled u . s. attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist , al-baghdadi . their sick agenda over national security
a new intelligence leak from the amazon washington post , this time against a . g. jeff sessions . these illegal leaks , like comeys , must stop!
sean spicer is a wonderful person who took tremendous abuse from the fake news media - but his future is bright!

melania and i send our thoughts and prayers to senator mccain , cindy , and their entire family . get well soon .
the republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is , & it will get even better at lunchtime . the dems scream death as ocare dies!
i will be having lunch at the white house today with republican senators concerning healthcare . they must keep their promise to america!
the fake news is becoming more and more dishonest ! even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in germany is made to look sinister!
fake news story of secret dinner with putin is sick . all g 20 leaders , and spouses , were invited by the chancellor of germany . press knew!
the senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes . even parts of full repeal need 60. 8 dems control senate . crazy!
with only a very small majority , the republicans in the house & senate need more victories next year since dems totally obstruct , no votes!
as i have always said , let obamacare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan . stay tuned!
we were let down by all of the democrats and a few republicans . most republicans were loyal , terrific & worked really hard . we will return!
republicans should just repeal failing obamacare now & work on a new healthcare plan that will start from a clean slate . dems will join in!
most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent . thats politics!
heading back to washington , DC much will be accomplished this week on trade , the military and security!
congratulations to sung hyun park on winning the 2017 @usga #uswomensopen🇺🇸

the abc/washington post poll , even though almost 40% is not bad at this time , was just about the most inaccurate poll around election time!
with all of its phony unnamed sources & highly slanted & even fraudulent reporting , #fake news is distorting democracy in our country!
thank you to former campaign adviser michael caputo for saying so powerfully that there was no russian collusion in our winning campaign.
thank you to all of the supporters , who far out-numbered the protesters , yesterday at the womens u . s. open . very cool!
hillaryclinton can illegally get the questions to the debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son don is being scorned by the fake news media?

@washtimes states democrats have willfully used moscow disinformation to influence the presidential election against donald trump.
isis is on the run & will soon be wiped out of syria & iraq , illegal border crossings are way down 75% & ms 13 gangs are being removed.
remember , when you hear the words sources say from the fake media , often times those sources are made up and do not exist.
my son donald did a good job last night . he was open , transparent and innocent . this is the greatest witch hunt in political history . sad!
my son , donald , will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10:00 p.m. he is a great person who loves our country!

james comey leaked classified information to the media . that is so illegal!
the fact that president putin and i discussed a cyber security unit doesnt mean i think it can happen . it cant-but a ceasefire can , & did!
syrian ceasefire seems to be holding . many lives can be saved . came out of meeting . good!
for years , even as a civilian , i listened as republicans pushed the repeal and replace of obamacare . now they finally have their chance!
make america great again !
sanctions were not discussed at my meeting with president putin . nothing will be done until the ukrainian & syrian problems are solved!
have it . fake news said 17 intel agencies when actually 4 had to apologize . why did obama do nothing when he had info before election?
and safe . questions were asked about why the cia & fbi had to ask the dnc 13 times for their server , and were rejected , still dont.
putin & i discussed forming an impenetrable cyber security unit so that election hacking , & many other negative things , will be guarded.
we negotiated a ceasefire in parts of syria which will save lives . now it is time to move forward in working constructively with russia!
i strongly pressed president putin twice about russian meddling in our election . he vehemently denied it . ive already given my opinion.
the g 20 summit was a great success for the u . s. - explained that the u . s. must fix the many bad trade deals it has made . will get done!

trade between china and north korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter . so much for china working with us - but we had to give it a try!

the #amazonwashingtonpost , sometimes referred to as the guardian of amazon not paying internet taxes which they should is fake news!
some of the fake news media likes to say that i am not totally engaged in healthcare . wrong , i know the subject well & want victory for u . s.
the failing @nytimes writes false story after false story about me . they dont even call to verify the facts of a story . a fake news joke!
i just finished a great meeting with the republican senators concerning healthcare . they really want to get it right , unlike ocare!
with zero democrats to help , and a failed , expensive and dangerous obamacare as the dems legacy , the republican senators are working hard!
so they caught fake news cnn cold , but what about nbc , cbs & abc ? what about the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost ? they are all fake news!
fake news cnn is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony russian stories . ratings way down!
wow , cnn had to retract big story on russia , with 3 employees forced to resign . what about all the other phony stories they do ? fake news!
great day for americas future security and safety , courtesy of the u . s. supreme court . i will keep fighting for the american people , & win!
from @foxnews bombshell: in 2016, obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an american election . check out his statement - witch hunt!
very grateful for the 9-o decision from the u . s . supreme court . we must keep america safe!
republican senators are working very hard to get there , with no help from the democrats . not easy ! perhaps just let ocare crash & burn!
under a magnifying glass , they have zero tapes of t people colluding . there is no collusion & no obstruction . i should be given apology!
the real story is that president obama did nothing after being informed in august about russian meddling . with 4 months looking at russia.
and did not want to rock the boat . he didnt choke , he colluded or obstructed , and it did the dems and crooked hillary no good.
the reason that president obama did nothing about russia after being notified by the cia of meddling is that he expected clinton would win.
the democrats have become nothing but obstructionists , they have no policies or ideas . all they do is delay and complain . they own obamacare!
i am on @foxandfriends - enjoy!
hillary clinton colluded with the democratic party in order to beat crazy bernie sanders . is she allowed to so collude ? unfair to bernie!
make america great again!
i cannot imagine that these very fine republican senators would allow the american people to suffer a broken obamacare any longer!
obama administration official said they choked when it came to acting on russian meddling of election . they didnt want to hurt hillary?
since the obama administration was told way before the 2016 election that the russians were meddling , why no action ? focus on them , not t!
democrats slam gop healthcare proposal as obamacare premiums & deductibles increase by over 100% . remember keep your doctor , keep your plan?
just out: the obama administration knew far in advance of november 8th about election meddling by russia . did nothing about it . why?

whether there are tapes or recordings of my conversations with james comey , but i did not make , and do not have , any such recordings.

i certainly hope the democrats do not force nancy p out . that would be very bad for the republican party - and please let cryin chuck stay!
why did the dnc refuse to turn over its server to the fbi , and still hasnt ? its all a big dem scam and excuse for losing the election!
why did democratic national committee turn down the dhs offer to protect against hacks long prior to election . its all a big dem hoax!
by the way , if russia was working so hard on the 2016 election , it all took place during the obama admin . why didnt they stop them?
former homeland security advisor jeh johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between trump & russia.

in any event we are extreme vetting people coming into the u . s. in order to help keep our country safe . the courts are slow and political!
the justice dept . should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down travel ban before the supreme court - & seek much tougher version!
the justice dept . should have stayed with the original travel ban , not the watered down , politically correct version they submitted to s . c.
people , the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want , but i am calling it what we need and what it is , a travel ban!
do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now ? thats because they used knives and a truck!
at least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and mayor of london says there is no reason to be alarmed!
we must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people . if we dont get smart it will only get worse
whatever the united states can do to help out in london and the u . k . , we will be there - we are with you . god bless!
we need to be smart , vigilant and tough . we need the courts to give us back our rights . we need the travel ban as an extra level of safety!

the ninth circuit , which has a terrible record of being overturned close to 80% . they used to call this judge shopping ! messy system.
out of our very big country , with many choices , does everyone notice that both the ban case and now the sanctuary case is brought in .
first the ninth circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings . see you in the supreme court!

the two fake news polls released yesterday , abc & nbc , while containing some very positive info , were totally wrong in general e . watch!
popular vote . abc news/washington post poll wrong big on election said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader.
new polls out today are very good considering that much of the media is fake and almost always negative . would still beat hillary in .
eventually , but at a later date so we can get started early , mexico will be paying , in some form , for the badly needed border wall.
the democrats dont want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad ms 13 gang members.
obamacare is in serious trouble . the dems need big money to keep it going - otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought.
thank you lake worth , florida . @foxandfriends

use subsidies to buy health plans . in other words , ocare is dead . good things will happen , however , either with republicans or dems.
the failing @nytimes finally gets it - in places where no insurance company offers plans , there will be no way for obamacare customers to.
it is the same fake news media that said there is no path to victory for trump that is now pushing the phony russia story . a total scam!

chris cuomo , in his interview with sen . blumenthal , never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave service in vietnam . fake news!
sen . richard blumenthal , who never fought in vietnam when he said for years he had major lie , now misrepresents what judge gorsuch told him?

the threat from radical islamic terrorism is very real , just look at what is happening in europe and the middle-east . courts must act fast!
the failing @nytimes was forced to apologize to its subscribers for the poor reporting it did on my election win . now they are worse!

will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 p.m.
i call my own shots , largely based on an accumulation of data , and everyone knows it . some fake news media , in order to marginalize , lies!

interview with @oreillyfactor on fox network - 4:00 p.m. prior to super bowl . enjoy!
why arent the lawyers looking at and using the federal court decision in boston , which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?
because the ban was lifted by a judge , many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country . a terrible decision
what is our country coming to when a judge can halt a homeland security travel ban and anyone , even with bad intentions , can come into u . s.?
make america great again!
after being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election , the fake news @nytimes is still lost!
the opinion of this so-called judge , which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country , is ridiculous and will be overturned!
interesting that certain middle-eastern countries agree with the ban . they know if certain people are allowed in its death & destruction!
when a country is no longer able to say who can , and who cannot , come in & out , especially for reasons of safety & . security - big trouble!
countries charge u . s. companies taxes or tariffs while the u . s. charges them nothing or little . we should charge them same as they charge us!
we must keep evil out of our country!

iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the u . s. came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the iran deal: $150 billion
iran has been formally put on notice for firing a ballistic missile . should have been thankful for the terrible deal the u . s. made with them!
attending chief ryan owens dignified transfer yesterday with my daughter ivanka was my great honor . to a great and brave man - thank you!
congratulations to rex tillerson on being sworn in as our new secretary of state . he will be a star!
if u . c. berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - no federal funds?
do you believe it ? the obama administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from australia . why ? i will study this dumb deal!
iran is rapidly taking over more and more of iraq even after the u . s. has squandered three trillion dollars there . obvious long ago!
everybody is arguing whether or not it is a ban . call it what you want , it is about keeping bad people with bad intentions out of country!

protesters and the tears of senator schumer . secretary kelly said that all is going well with very few problems . make america safe again!
only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning . big problems at airports were caused by delta computer outage , .
i will be interviewed by @thebrodyfile on @cbnnews tonight at 11pm . enjoy!
statement regarding recent executive order concerning extreme vetting:
senators should focus their energies on isis , illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start world war iii.
the joint statement of former presidential candidates john mccain & lindsey graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration . the two.
christians in the middle-east have been executed in large numbers . we cannot allow this horror to continue!
our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting , now . look what is happening all over europe and , indeed , the world - a horrible mess!
somebody with aptitude and conviction should buy the fake news and failing @nytimes and either run it correctly or let it fold with dignity!
i will be interviewed by @thebrodyfile on @cbnnews tonight at 11pm . enjoy!
today , we remember the crew of the space shuttle challenger , 31 years later . #neverforget

of jobs and companies lost . if mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall , then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.
the u . s. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with mexico . it has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of nafta with massive numbers.

@thealabamaband was great last night in DC playing for 147 diplomats and ambassadors from countries around the world . thanks alabama!
no wonder the today show on biased @nbc is doing so badly compared to its glorious past . little credibility!
bayer ag has pledged to add u . s. jobs and investments after meeting with president-elect donald trump , the latest in a string . @wsj
to the u . s. , but had nothing to do with trump , is more fake news . ask top ceos of those companies for real facts . came back because of me!
totally biased @nbcnews went out of its way to say that the big announcement from ford , g . m. , lockheed & others that jobs are coming back.
will be interviewed by @ainsleyearhardt on @foxandfriends - enjoy!
thank you to general motors and walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the u . s.!
how trump won-and how the media missed it
thought it would be hypocritical to attend bushs swearing-in . he doesnt believe bush is the true elected president . sound familiar ! wp
john lewis said about my inauguration , it will be the first one that ive missed . wrong or lie ! he boycotted bush 43 also because he.
country and with the massive cost reductions i have negotiated on military purchases and more , i believe the people are seeing big stuff.
with all of the jobs i am bringing back into the u . s. even before taking office , with all of the new auto plants coming back into our.
the same people who did the phony election polls , and were so wrong , are now doing approval rating polls . they are rigged just like before.
people are pouring into washington in record numbers . bikers for trump are on their way . it will be a great thursday , friday and saturday!
at 9:00 p.m. @cnn , of all places , is doing a special report on my daughter , ivanka . considering it is cnn , cant imagine it will be great!
celebrate martin luther king day and all of the many wonderful things that he stood for . honor him for being the great man that he was!
much worse - just look at syria red line , crimea , ukraine and the build-up of russian nukes . not good ! was this the leaker of fake news?
@foxnews outgoing cia chief , john brennan , blasts pres-elect trump on russia threat . does not fully understand . oh really , couldnt do.
@nbcnews is bad but saturday night live is the worst of nbc . not funny , cast is terrible , always a complete hit job . really bad television!
about that . those intelligence chiefs made a mistake here , & when people make mistakes , they should apologize . media should also apologize
thank you to bob woodward who said , that is a garbage document . it never should have been presented . trumps right to be upset angry.
for many years our country has been divided , angry and untrusting . many say it will never change , the hatred is too deep . it will change ! !!!
will only get higher . car companies and others , if they want to do business in our country , have to start making things here again . win!
the democrats are most angry that so many obama democrats voted for me . with all of the jobs i am bringing back to our nation , that number.
inauguration day is turning out to be even bigger than expected . january 20th , washington DC have fun!
congressman john lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the u . s. i can use all the help i can get!
intelligence insiders now claim the trump dossier is a complete fraud ! @oann
mention crime infested rather than falsely complaining about the election results . all talk , talk , talk - no action or results . sad!
congressman john lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district , which is in horrible shape and falling apart not to.
a beautiful funeral today for a real nyc hero , detective steven mcdonald . our law enforcement community has my complete and total support.
the unaffordable care act will soon be history!
have been allowed to run - guilty as hell . they were very nice to her . she lost because she campaigned in the wrong states - no enthusiasm!
what are hillary clintons people complaining about with respect to the f . b.i . based on the information they had she should never.
released by intelligence even knowing there is no proof , and never will be . my people will have a full report on hacking within 90 days!
totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives , both democrats and republicans - fake news ! russia says nothing exists . probably.
it now turns out that the phony allegations against me were put together by my political opponents and a failed spy afraid of being sued.
all of my cabinet nominee are looking good and doing a great job . i want them to be themselves and express their own thoughts , not mine!
congrats to the senate for taking the first step to #repealobamacare- now its onto the house!
@cnn is in a total meltdown with their fake news because their ratings are tanking since election and their credibility will soon be gone!
thank you to linda bean of l . l.bean for your great support and courage . people will support you even more now . buy l . l.bean . @lbperfectmaine
james clapper called me yesterday to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated . made up , phony facts . too bad!
we had a great news conference at trump tower today . a couple of fake news organizations were there but the people truly get whats going on
intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to leak into the public . one last shot at me . are we living in nazi germany?
i win an election easily , a great movement is verified , and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with fake news . a sorry state!
russia has never tried to use leverage over me . i have nothing to do with russia - no deals , no loans , no nothing!
russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is a complete and total fabrication , utter nonsense . very unfair!
buzzfeed runs unverifiable trump-russia claims #fakenews
fake news - a total political witch hunt!
trump helps lift small business confidence to 12-yr . high

its finally happening - fiat chrysler just announced plans to invest $1billion in michigan and ohio plants , adding 2000 jobs . this after.
groveling when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad . just more very dishonest media!
hillary flunky who lost big . for the 100th time , i never mocked a disabled reporter would never do that but simply showed him.
meryl streep , one of the most over-rated actresses in hollywood , doesnt know me but attacked last night at the golden globes . she is a.
rupert murdoch is a great guy who likes me much better as a very successful candidate than he ever did as a very successful developer!
dishonest media says mexico wont be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly . media is fake!
before i , or anyone , saw the classified and/or highly confidential hacking intelligence report , it was leaked out to @nbcnews . so serious!
kellyanne conway went to @meetthepress this morning for an interview with @chucktodd . dishonest media cut out 9 of her 10 minutes . terrible!
i look very much forward to meeting prime minister theresa may in washington in the spring . britain , a longtime u . s. ally , is very special!
congratulation to jane timken on her major upset victory in becoming the ohio republican party chair . jane is a loyal trump supporter & star
both countries will , perhaps , work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the world!
have enough problems around the world without yet another one . when i am president , russia will respect us far more than they do now and.
having a good relationship with russia is a good thing , not a bad thing . only stupid people , or fools , would think that it is bad ! we.
only reason the hacking of the poorly defended dnc is discussed is that the loss by the dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!
intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results . voting machines not touched!
gross negligence by the democratic national committee allowed hacking to take place . the republican national committee had strong defense!
happy birthday @erictrump !
monitoring the terrible situation in florida . just spoke to governor scott . thoughts and prayers for all . stay safe!
i am asking the chairs of the house and senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with nbc prior to me seeing it.
anna wintour came to my office at trump tower to ask me to meet with the editors of conde nast & steven newhouse , a friend . will go this am.
being a movie star-and that was season 1 compared to season 14. now compare him to my season 1. but who cares , he supported kasich & hillary
wow , the ratings are in and arnold schwarzenegger got swamped or destroyed by comparison to the ratings machine , djt . so much for.
hopefully , all supporters , and those who want to make america great again , will go to DC on january 20th . it will be a great show!
and knew they were in big trouble - which is why they cancelled their big fireworks at the last minute . they saw a movement like never before
hillary and the dems were never going to beat the passion of my voters . they saw what was happening in the last two weeks before the.
the dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the great wall for sake of speed , will be paid back by mexico later!
so how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers ? what is going on?
the democratic national committee would not allow the fbi to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by russia.
how did nbc get an exclusive look into the top secret report he obama was presented ? who gave them this report and why ? politics!
toyota motor said will build a new plant in baja , mexico , to build corolla cars for u . s. no way ! build plant in u . s. or pay big border tax.
to make up their own minds as to the truth . the media lies to make it look like i am against intelligence when in fact i am a big fan!
the dishonest media likes saying that i am in agreement with julian assange - wrong . i simply state what he states , it is for the people.
time for republicans & democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works - much less expensive & far better!
do the typical political thing and blame . the fact is obamacare was a lie from the beginning . keep you doctor , keep your plan ! it is.
the democrats , lead by head clown chuck schumer , know how bad obamacare is and what a mess they are in . instead of working to fix it , they.
jackie evanchos album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performance . some people just dont understand the movement
massive increases of obamacare will take place this year and dems are to blame for the mess . it will fall of its own weight - be careful!
like the 116% hike in arizona . also , deductibles are so high that it is practically useless . dont let the schumer clowns out of this web.
republicans must be careful in that the dems own the failed obamacare disaster , with its poor coverage and massive premium increases.
things they did and said like giving the questions to the debate to h . a total double standard ! media , as usual , gave them a pass.
somebody hacked the dnc but why did they not have hacking defense like the rnc has and why have they not responded to the terrible.
thank you to ford for scrapping a new plant in mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the u . s. this is just the beginning - much more to follow
julian assange said a 14 year old could have hacked podesta - why was dnc so careless ? also said russians did not give him the info!
the intelligence briefing on so-called russian hacking was delayed until friday , perhaps more time needed to build a case . very strange!
i will be having a general news conference on january eleventh in n . y.c . thank you.
trump is already delivering the jobs he promised america
there should be no further releases from gitmo . these are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield.
instead of driving jobs and wealth away , america will become the worlds great magnet for innovation & job creation .
may be , their number one act and priority . focus on tax reform , healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance ! #dts
with all that congress has to work on , do they really have to make the weakening of the independent ethics watchdog , as unfair as it
the democrat governor . of minnesota said the affordable care act obamacare is no longer affordable ! - and , it is lousy healthcare.
people must remember that obamacare just doesnt work , and it is not affordable - 116% increases arizona . bill clinton called it crazy
general motors is sending mexican made model of chevy cruze to u . s. car dealers-tax free across border . make in u . s.a . or pay big border tax!
china has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the u . s. in totally one-sided trade , but wont help with north korea . nice!
north korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the u . s. it wont happen!
i thought and felt i would win big , easily over the fabled 270 306. when they cancelled fireworks , they knew , and so did i.
various media outlets and pundits say that i thought i was going to lose the election . wrong , it all came together in the last week and.
@cnn just released a book called unprecedented which explores the 2016 race & victory . hope it does well but used worst cover photo of me!

we cannot continue to let israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect . they used to have a great friend in the u . s. , but.
doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory president o statements and roadblocks . thought it was going to be a smooth transition - not!
the u . s. consumer confidence index for december surged nearly four points to 113.7, the highest level in more than 15 years ! thanks donald!
president obama campaigned hard and personally in the very important swing states , and lost . the voters wanted to make america great again!
the djt foundation , unlike most foundations , never paid fees , rent , salaries or any expenses . 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!
i gave millions of dollars to djt foundation , raised or recieved millions more , all of which is given to charity , and media wont report!
the world was gloomy before i won - there was no hope . now the market is up nearly 10% and christmas spending is over a trillion dollars!
the united nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together , talk and have a good time . so sad!
president obama said that he thinks he would have won against me . he should say that but i say no way ! - jobs leaving , isis , ocare , etc.
merry christmas and a very , very , very , very happy new year to everyone!
#merrychristmas
@foxnews - objectified tonight at 10:00 p.m. enjoy!
happy #hanukkah
the big loss yesterday for israel in the united nations will make it much harder to negotiate peace . too bad , but we will get it done anyway!
@nbcnews purposely left out this part of my nuclear qoute: until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes . dishonest!
vladimir putin said today about hillary and dems: in my opinion , it is humiliating . one must be able to lose with dignity . so true!
slaughter you . this is a purely religious threat , which turned into reality . such hatred ! when will the u . s. , and all countries , fight back?
the terrorist who killed so many people in germany said just before crime , by gods will we will slaughter you pigs , i swear , we will.
as to the u . n. , things will be different after jan . 20th.
my presidency . isnt this a ridiculous shame ? he loves these kids , has raised millions of dollars for them , and now must stop . wrong answer!
my wonderful son , eric , will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with.
the so-called a list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration , but look what they did for hillary , nothing . i want the people!
based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the lockheed martin f-35, i have asked boeing to price-out a comparable f-18 super hornet!
the united states must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes
someone incorrectly stated that the phrase drain the swamp was no longer being used by me . actually , we will always be trying to dts.
the resolution being considered at the united nations security council regarding israel should be vetoed . cont:
i met some really great air force generals and navy admirals today , talking about airplane capability and pricing . very impressive people!
i have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that i spent far less money on the win than hillary on the loss!
i would have done even better in the election , if that is possible , if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently
campaigning to win the electoral college is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote . hillary focused on the wrong states!
yes , it is true - carlos slim , the great businessman from mexico , called me about getting together for a meeting . we met , he is a great guy!
especially how to get people , even with an unlimited budget , out to vote in the vital swing states and more . they focused on wrong states
bill clinton stated that i called him after the election . wrong , he called me with a very nice congratulations . he doesnt know much .
we did it ! thank you to all of my great supporters , we just officially won the election despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media.
today there were terror attacks in turkey , switzerland and germany - and it is only getting worse . the civilized world must change thinking!
if my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing , they would be scorned & called terrible names!
we should tell china that we dont want the drone they stole back- let them keep it!
thank you alabama ! from now on , it’s going to be #americafirst . our goal is to bring back that wonderful phrase:…

hillarys staff thought her email scandal might just blow over . who would trust these people with national security ?
a country that crooked hillary says has funded isis also gave wild bill $1 million for his birthday ? so corrupt !
they let crooked & the gang off the hook for the crime , but it looks like the cover-up is just as bad . unbelievable !
election is being rigged by the media , in a coordinated effort with the clinton campaign , by putting stories that never happened into news!

did crooked hillary help disgusting check out sex tape and past alicia m become a u . s. citizen so she could use her in the debate?
using alicia m in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that crooked hillary suffers from bad judgement ! hillary was set up by a con.
wow , crooked hillary was duped and used by my worst miss u . hillary floated her as an angel without checking her past , which is terrible!

my lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent . i said no for now , but they are watching . really disgusting
the failing @nytimes has gone nuts that crooked hillary is doing so badly . they are willing to say anything , has become a laughingstock rag!
crazy maureen dowd , the wacky columnist for the failing @nytimes , pretends she knows me well-wrong!
wacky @nytimesdowd , who hardly knows me , makes up things that i never said for her boring interviews and column . a neurotic dope!
@cnn just doesnt get it , and thats why their ratings are so low - and getting worse . boring anti-trump panelists , mostly losers in life!
i never met former defense secretary robert gates . he knows nothing about me . but look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!
crooked hillary wants to take your 2nd amendment rights away . will guns be taken from her heavily armed secret service detail ? maybe not!
my thoughts and prayers go out to the @phillypolice & @penn police officers- in philadelphia .

the seriously failing @nytimes , despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place , only writes dishonest hits!
hillary clinton just had her 47% moment . what a terrible thing she said about so many great americans!
while hillary said horrible things about my supporters , and while many of her supporters will never vote for me , i still respect them all!
really sad that republicans would allow themselves to be used in a clinton ad . lindsey graham , romney , flake , sass . supreme court , remember!
wow , hillary clinton was so insulting to my supporters , millions of amazing , hard working people . i think it will cost her at the polls!

henry mcmaster , lt . governor of south carolina who endorsed me , beat failed @cnn announcer bakari sellers , so badly . funny!
jeff zucker failed @nbc and he is now failing @cnn.
@cnn is unwatchable . their news on me is fiction . they are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the clinton campaign.
the documentary of me that @cnn just aired is a total waste of time . i dont even know many of the people who spoke about me . a joke!
final poll results from nbc on last nights commander-in-chief forum . thank you ! #imwithyou #maga
it wasnt matt lauer that hurt hillary last night . it was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail.
more poll results from last nights commander-in-chief forum . #americafirst #trumptrain
last nights results - in poll taken by nbc . #americafirst #imwithyou
with luis , mexico and the united states would have made wonderful deals together - where both mexico and the us would have benefitted.
mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who i know is highly respected by president peña nieto.
hillary clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past . she is totally confused . unfit to serve as #potus.
hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night . shes being decimated by the media!
a rough night for hillary clinton abc news.

the polls are close so crooked hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow . why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?
the great state of arizona , where i just had a massive rally amazing people , has a very weak and ineffective senator , jeff flake . sad!
the republican party needs strong and committed leaders , not weak people such as @jeffflake , if it is going to stop illegal immigration.
crooked hillarys v . p. pick said this morning that i was not aware that russia took over crimea . a total lie - and taken over during o term!
wow , the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on crookeds fbi release . they are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source
@cnn is so disgusting in their bias , but they are having a hard time promoting crooked hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.

now that african-americans are seeing what a bad job hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities , they want trump!
crooked hillarys brainpower is highly overrated . probably why her decision making is so bad or , as stated by bernie s , she has bad judgement
does anyone know that crooked hillary , who tried so hard , was unable to pass the bar exams in washington DC she was forced to go elsewhere
inner-city crime is reaching record levels . african-americans will vote for trump because they know i will stop the slaughter going on!
look how bad it is getting ! how much more crime , how many more shootings , will it take for african-americans and latinos to vote trump=safe!
i will be making a major speech on illegal immigration on wednesday in the great state of arizona . big crowds , looking for a larger venue.
i think that both candidates , crooked hillary and myself , should release detailed medical records . i have no problem in doing so ! hillary?
today is the 53rd anniversary of the march on washington - today we honor the enduring fight for justice , equality and opportunity.
thank you arizona ! #votetrump

hillary clinton deleted emails using program intended to prevent recovery #crookedhillary
how quickly people forget that crooked hillary called african-american youth super predators - has she apologized?
i am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion . such a big problem for our country-i will solve
wonderful @pastormarkburns was attacked viciously and unfairly on @msnbc by crazy @morningmika on low ratings @morning_joe . apologize!
what do african-americans and hispanics have to lose by going with me . look at the poverty , crime and educational statistics . i will fix it!
crooked hillary will never be able to solve the problems of poverty , education and safety within the african-american & hispanic communities
the clintons are the real predators .
hillary clinton needs to address the racist undertones of her 2008 campaign . #flashbackfriday
clinton corruption and her sabotage of the inner cities . full speech transcript:
hillary clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me . no policy , and always very short stamina . media gives her a pass!
hrc is using the oldest play in the dem playbook- when their policies fail , they are left w/this one tired argument !
hillary clinton is using race-baiting to try to get african-american voters- but they know she is all talk and no action!
hillary clintons short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society . she should be ashamed of herself!
just watched recap of #crookedhillarys speech . very short and lies . she is the only one fear-mongering!
so many in the african-american community are doing so badly , poverty and crime way up , employment and jobs way down: i will fix it , promise
poll numbers are starting to look very good . leading in florida @cnn arizona and big jump in utah . all numbers rising , national way up . wow!
thoughts and prayers to the great people of indiana . you will prevail!
great governor @mike_pence is in indiana to help lead the relief efforts after tornadoes struck . true leadership.
will be on #hannity @ 10pe @foxnews- discussing various subjects including immigration-if elected , we will #buildthewall & enforce our laws!

president obama should have gone to louisiana days ago , instead of golfing . too little , too late!
hillary clinton strongly stated that there was absolutely no connection between her private work and that of the state department . lie!
it is being reported by virtually everyone , and is a fact , that the media pile on against me is the worst in american political history!
i am now in texas doing a big fundraiser for the republican party and a @foxnews special on the border and with victims of border crime!
the @washingtonpost quickly put together a hit job book on me- comprised of copies of some of their inaccurate stories . dont buy , boring!
@anncoulters new book , in trump we trust , comes out tomorrow . people are saying its terrific - knowing ann i am sure it is!
just leaving akron , ohio , after a packed rally . amazing people ! going now to texas.

will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:30 a.m. eastern . enjoy!
some day , when things calm down , ill tell the real story of @joenbc and his very insecure long-time girlfriend , @morningmika . two clowns!
tried watching low-rated @morning_joe this morning , unwatchable ! @morningmika is off the wall , a neurotic and not very bright mess!
i heard that @morning_joe was very nice on friday but that little donny d , a big failure in tv & someone i helped , was nasty . irrelevant!
crooked hillary is flooding the airwaves with false and misleading ads - all paid for by her bosses on wall street . media is protecting her!
i have been drawing very big and enthusiastic crowds , but the media refuses to show or discuss them . something very big is happening!
together , we are going to make america safe and great again !
we will bring america together as one country again – united as americans in common purpose and common dreams . #maga

will be on @seanhannity tonight at 10pme - delivering an important speech live from wisconsin . #makeamericagreatagain
just as we won the cold war , in part , by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets . cont:
this is my pledge to the american people:
its just a 2-point race , clinton 38% , trump 36%
another health insurer is pulling back due to persistent financial losses on #obamacare plans . only the beginning !
#americasmerkel
clinton refugee plan could bring in 620,000 refugees in first term at lifetime cost of over $400 billion .
#makeamericasafeagain
certain republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the u . s.supreme court get proper appointments . sad!
stay on message is the chant . i always do - trade , jobs , military , vets , 2nd a , repeal ocare , borders , etc - but media misrepresents!
i have always been the same person-remain true to self . the media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
it is not freedom of the press when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
i am not only fighting crooked hillary , i am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process . people get it!
crooked hillary clinton is being protected by the media . she is not a talented person or politician . the dishonest media refuses to expose!
my rallies are not covered properly by the media . they never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
if the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didnt put false meaning into the words i say , i would be beating hillary by 20%
the failing @nytimes , which never spoke to me , keeps saying that i am saying to advisers that i will change . false , i am who i am-never said
the failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened . their reporting is fiction . the media protects hillary!
we now have confirmation as to one reason crooked h wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - pay-for-play . how can she run for pres.
i am truly enjoying myself while running for president . the people of our country are amazing - great numbers on november 8th!
the failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction . their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources . very dishonest!
will be on @seanhannity tonight at 10pm , hosted by @govmikehuckabee . enjoy!
thank you erie , pennsylvania ! together we will #makeamericagreatagain !
unbelievable support in florida last night - thank you ! #maga
we need your support to get to the white house and defeat #crookedhillary . lets make america great again !
the establishment and special interests are absolutely killing our country . we must put #americafirst .
